== A Pointless Meeting Party

After knocking twice with no response, Bob cautiously pushed open the door to the Marketing Department. The scene that greeted him was simultaneously familiar and bizarre—a large conference room dominated by an oval table, but one that appeared to extend much further than the room's dimensions should allow.

The table was cluttered with laptops, tablets, coffee cups, half-eaten pastries, and stacks of papers that looked untouched. A presentation was frozen on the screen at the front of the room, displaying a slide titled "PARADIGM-SHIFTING BRAND EVOLUTION STRATEGY (DAY 42)."

Three people sat at the far end of the table despite there being at least twenty empty chairs. They were engaged in what appeared to be an intense discussion, complete with animated gestures and occasional bursts of strained laughter.

"Excuse me," Bob called out, but none of them seemed to notice his entrance.

He walked further into the room, taking in more details. Every wall clock showed exactly 4:59 PM, despite his watch indicating it was now closer to 3:45. Scattered around the room were numerous empty coffee cups, some looking quite old based on the dried residue inside them.

As Bob approached the occupied end of the table, he could finally make out the conversation.

"—which is why I maintain that cross-platform synergistic messaging requires disruptive innovation in our omnichannel strategy!" declared a man in a blindingly colorful suit and a bow tie that appeared to be made of actual blinking LED lights. His wild hair stood in all directions, and he wore at least three Bluetooth earpieces—one in each ear and a third inexplicably clipped to his eyebrow.

"But we've already pivoted our core messaging framework six times this quarter," replied a frazzled-looking woman with nervous, twitchy movements. She was surrounded by multiple phones that kept buzzing, each time causing her to jump slightly. "The press release has been rewritten seventeen times, Timothy!"

"Details, details, Marcia!" the man—presumably Timothy Hatter, the Marketing Director—waved dismissively. "Brands are living entities! They require constant nourishment through strategic repositioning!"

The third person at the table, a young woman who appeared to be in her early twenties, was slumped forward with her head on her laptop keyboard, apparently asleep. Neither of the others seemed to find this strange.

Bob cleared his throat loudly. This time, all three looked up—even the sleeping intern, who jerked awake with a snort, leaving a keyboard imprint on her cheek.

"We have a visitor!" Timothy announced with exaggerated delight, as if Bob were a long-lost friend rather than a stranger. "Come in, come in! Are you from the Brand Perception Analytics team? We've been waiting for your segment input!"

"No room! No room!" Marcia contradicted anxiously, gesturing at the nearly empty table. "The agenda is already overcapacity!"

"I'm not from Analytics," Bob explained. "I'm new to the company. Bob Henderson." He gestured at his badge. "I was just—"

"New?" Timothy's eyes lit up. "Perfect! A fresh perspective is exactly what this ideation session needs!" He pointed to a chair. "Sit! Sit! We're just getting to the good part!"

"I've been here since 9 AM," mumbled the young intern, rubbing her eyes. "Is it still Tuesday?"

"It's Monday," Bob said gently. "February 25th."

The intern looked genuinely confused. "But we started this meeting last Tuesday..."

"Time is subjective in strategic planning sessions, Dora," Timothy declared, tapping his multiple watches. He was, Bob now noticed, wearing at least five of them on each wrist, all showing different times. "We exist in a deadline-fluid paradigm."

"I really just stopped by to ask for directions," Bob tried again. "I'm trying to find my way back to the main reception or HR."

"Directions? We've got plenty of those!" Timothy laughed uproariously at his own joke. "North, south, east, west, up, down, inside-out! Marketing is multidimensional navigation of the consumer psyche!"

Marcia abruptly stood, gathering her devices. "We need to shift positions! Optimization requirement!"

Without explanation, everyone—including Dora, who moved as if on autopilot—stood up and moved one seat to the right. Timothy gestured impatiently for Bob to take Dora's vacated seat.

Not seeing an alternative that wouldn't seem rude, Bob sat down. "What exactly is this meeting about?"

All three looked at him as if he'd asked why water was wet.

"It's The Meeting," Dora said, as if that explained everything.

"The perpetual alignment summit," Marcia added, checking all her phones in rapid succession.

"The never-ending story of brand evolution!" Timothy spread his arms dramatically. "We're currently on slide 39 of 2,394, though we frequently loop back to earlier concepts when experiencing strategic clarity deficits."

Bob glanced at the presentation screen, which still hadn't changed. "How long has this meeting been going on?"

The three exchanged glances.

"What day did you say it was?" Timothy asked, squinting at his collection of watches.

"Monday. February 25th," Bob repeated.

Timothy consulted a comically large calendar on the wall. "Then we're on day... 37 of the Q1 Marketing Strategy Synergization Summit."

"Thirty-seven days?" Bob asked incredulously.

"Is that a long time?" Timothy seemed genuinely puzzled. "Time moves differently in Marketing. We're temporally disruptive."

"It's because we broke Time," Dora said matter-of-factly, then immediately dropped her head back onto her laptop and appeared to fall instantly asleep.

"Broke time?" Bob echoed, wondering if he'd misheard.

"A most unfortunate incident," Timothy nodded solemnly. "We were preparing for the Heart Rebranding Campaign launch last year—or was it next year?—when we attempted to move a deadline."

"We didn't just move it," Marcia interjected, twitching as another phone buzzed. "We attempted to eliminate it completely through temporal reorganization."

"Time didn't appreciate our disruptive approach," Timothy continued. "Now all our meetings exist in a state of perpetual progression without conclusion."

"That's... not possible," Bob said carefully.

"And yet, here we are!" Timothy gestured around the room. "Eternally strategizing, forever ideating, continuously aligning!"

Marcia leaned toward Bob conspiratorially. "The clocks haven't moved since The Incident. We've tried replacing them, but they all freeze at 4:59 PM. It's always almost time to leave, but never quite time."

"Have you considered just... ending the meeting?" Bob suggested. "Standing up and walking out?"

All three stared at him in horror.

"End a meeting without actionable next steps and comprehensive stakeholder alignment?" Marcia clutched her collection of phones to her chest as if Bob had suggested something obscene.

"Without a properly formulated go-to-market strategy with full channel penetration planning?" Timothy looked physically pained by the thought.

"Without completing the deck?" Dora had awoken again, her expression aghast.

Before Bob could respond, Timothy clapped his hands. "Coffee break! Rotate positions!"

Once again, everyone stood and moved one seat to the right. Bob, baffled but not wanting to appear difficult, followed suit.

"But there's already coffee on the table," he pointed out, gesturing to the numerous cups.

"True, but no one ever drinks it," Timothy explained, settling into his new seat. "It's a symbolic caffeine ritual representing our perpetual state of almost-productivity."

Bob noticed that all the pastries on the table were similarly untouched despite looking stale. "Does no one eat, either?"

"Can't eat until the meeting concludes," Marcia said, arranging her phones in a semi-circle around her new position. "It's in the agenda. Item 2,347: 'Celebratory sustenance upon strategic alignment achievement.'"

"But if the meeting never ends..."

"Precisely why we're always so energized!" Timothy beamed, though Bob noticed the deep exhaustion behind his manic expression. "Nothing motivates like perpetual anticipation of conclusion!"

Dora mumbled something incoherent, her face once again pressed against her keyboard.

"What was that?" Bob asked.

Timothy waved dismissively. "Dora occasionally offers brilliant insights in her semiconscious state. Last week—or perhaps it was tomorrow—she provided the naming convention for our new Dashboard while sleeptalking."

"We implemented it immediately," Marcia added. "Though we're not entirely sure what it means."

Timothy suddenly focused intently on Bob. "Why is a whitepaper like a webinar?"

"I... don't know," Bob replied, taken aback by the non-sequitur.

"Exactly!" Timothy seemed delighted by this response. "No one does! Yet we produce thousands of both annually!"

"That doesn't make any sense," Bob said.

"Welcome to marketing," Marcia responded dryly, then jumped as three of her phones buzzed simultaneously. "Potential PR crisis brewing on social media! Someone used our brand name in conjunction with an unflattering emoji!"

Timothy leaned toward his multiple Bluetooth devices. "Deploy the sentiment adjustment team! Activate the positive engagement protocols!"

"Is that really necessary for an emoji?" Bob asked.

Both stared at him as if he'd suggested canceling Christmas.

"Brand perception exists in a quantum state of perpetual vulnerability," Timothy explained gravely. "One misplaced emoji can collapse the entire wave function of consumer confidence."

"We once lost 0.03% market share when a celebrity used our competitor's product in an Instagram story background," Marcia added, furiously typing on multiple devices. "Never again."

Bob was beginning to feel disoriented by the conversation, which seemed to swirl around actual meaning without ever quite landing on it. He decided to try a different approach.

"Could you at least tell me what Wonderland, Inc. actually does as a company? What products or services does it offer?"

The question was met with stunned silence. Timothy and Marcia exchanged confused glances.

"What Wonderland does?" Timothy repeated slowly, as if the question were in a foreign language.

"Yes," Bob pressed. "What's the core business?"

"Well, we..." Timothy began, then frowned. "That is to say, our primary value proposition centers around..."

"Our mission statement clearly defines our business as..." Marcia attempted, then faltered.

Dora mumbled, "We make the things that do the stuff for the people who need the solutions."

"Exactly!" Timothy pointed enthusiastically at the intern. "Couldn't have said it better myself! We're solution providers in the experience economy!"

"But solutions to what problems?" Bob persisted.

"All problems!" Timothy spread his arms wide. "And problems yet to be discovered! We're pre-solving future challenges through proactive innovation engineering!"

Bob realized he wasn't going to get a straight answer. "I think I should probably continue trying to find my way out."

"But you can't leave now!" Marcia protested. "We haven't gotten to your segment of the presentation!"

"I don't have a segment," Bob reminded her. "I'm not even supposed to be in this meeting."

"Everyone has a segment," Timothy insisted. "That's the beauty of inclusive stakeholder engagement!"

He clicked a remote, and the presentation finally advanced to a new slide titled "FEEDBACK FROM UNDEFINED CONTRIBUTORS WITH UNCERTAIN RELEVANCE TO CORE OBJECTIVES."

"See?" Timothy gestured proudly at the screen. "Your slide!"

The slide was completely blank apart from the title.

"I don't have any feedback to contribute," Bob said apologetically. "I still don't understand what you're planning for the Dashboard."

Timothy's expression suddenly shifted, becoming uncharacteristically serious. "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

"What?" Bob was confused by the abrupt change of topic.

"Your perception," Timothy clarified, tapping his temple. "Sometimes you need to reboot your conceptual framework to achieve synaptic disruption."

"I don't know what that means," Bob admitted.

"It means," Timothy leaned forward, "that you're trying to understand Wonderland through conventional corporate logic. That's like trying to smell the color nine. You'll never grasp the essence until you abandon the constraints of traditional business coherence."

There was an unexpected depth to this statement that caught Bob off guard. For a brief moment, Timothy seemed almost lucid despite his bizarre appearance and manner.

The moment was shattered when Marcia suddenly shrieked, "Social media crisis escalating! The emoji has been retweeted!"

"All hands on deck!" Timothy shouted, leaping to his feet. "Deploy the meme countermeasures! Initialize hashtag defense protocols!"

"I'll prepare statements for sixteen different platforms," Marcia declared, gathering her phones.

"I'll create diversionary content," Dora added, suddenly fully awake and typing furiously.

The three moved into what appeared to be a well-rehearsed crisis management choreography, completely forgetting about Bob as they activated what they called their "perception protection pyramid."

Bob took advantage of the chaos to quietly stand and edge toward the door. As he reached it, he heard Timothy call out, "Wait! You haven't defined your action items!"

"I'll circle back on that," Bob replied, using their own corporate-speak against them.

This response was met with approving nods.

"Excellent deferment strategy," Timothy commended. "Very marketing of you."

"We'll add you to the follow-up meeting series," Marcia added, tapping on one of her devices. "Only 347 sessions scheduled so far."

"Looking forward to it," Bob lied, backing through the doorway.

As he closed the door behind him, he caught one last glimpse of the bizarre trio: Timothy standing on his chair proclaiming something about "paradigm-shifting content strategy," Marcia simultaneously engaging with what appeared to be six different crisis communications channels, and Dora once again fast asleep on her keyboard despite the commotion.

Bob exhaled deeply once the door was shut, leaning against the wall of the hallway. Each department at Wonderland seemed stranger than the last, and he was no closer to finding his way out of the building or understanding his role within the company.

"Time is broken," he muttered to himself, remembering Timothy's bizarre explanation. It couldn't possibly be true, and yet...

His contemplation was interrupted by the sound of hurried footsteps and animated voices approaching from around the corner. Bob straightened up, hoping it might be someone who could finally provide sensible directions.

Instead, he saw a large group of people in formal business attire, all following a woman whose imperious bearing and severe expression immediately commanded attention. Even from a distance, the atmosphere of fear she generated was palpable—employees practically pressed themselves against the walls to make way for her.

"The quarterly review begins now!" she announced in a voice that brooked no disagreement. "Anyone not present on the south lawn in three minutes will be terminated immediately!"

Bob recognized her from the video call in the Analytics Department—Regina Heart, the CEO of Wonderland, Inc. And she was heading straight toward him, followed by what appeared to be the entire executive team.

With no time to consider his options, Bob did the only thing that seemed rational in that moment: he slipped through the nearest door, which happened to be labeled "Roof Access - Authorized Personnel Only."

Finding himself in a stairwell, he quickly climbed up, hoping to avoid the CEO and her entourage. When he emerged onto the roof, he was surprised to find a vast, manicured space that looked more like a formal garden than the top of a building.

And even more surprisingly, it was filled with people setting up what appeared to be some kind of performance review event.
