== Who Stole the Intellectual Property?

The atrium had been transformed into a corporate courtroom with disturbing efficiency. The judge's bench stood imposingly at the front, flanked by a witness stand on one side and what appeared to be a defendant's box on the other. Behind these formal fixtures, a large screen displayed a PowerPoint slide titled "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS (CONFIDENTIAL - LEVEL 9 CLEARANCE)."

Employees filled every available space, arranged by department and seniority. The executives occupied the front row on plush chairs that looked suspiciously like jury boxes, while middle management crowded the center section in standard office chairs. Lower-level employees stood at the back, many craning their necks to see over the heads of others.

"This is madness," Bob whispered to Morris as they positioned themselves strategically near an emergency exit. "Is an actual trial really happening?"

"Regina's Corporate Adjudication Events are a Wonderland tradition," Morris explained quietly. "Quasi-judicial proceedings for everything from missed targets to inappropriate refrigerator usage."

"Last quarter, she put the entire Accounting department on trial for 'conspiracy to commit pessimistic forecasting,'" Gregory added. "Three received suspensions, and one was reassigned to the basement archive."

Regina stood at the center of the stage, her crimson suit seeming even more vivid under the spotlight. She held her leather-bound innovation journal with the protective reverence one might give a sacred text. Karl Heart hovered nearby, his expression suggesting he was mentally calculating potential severance packages.

"Bring in the accused!" Regina commanded.

Two security guards escorted Victor Hartman, VP of Product, to the defendant's box. Victor was a tall, polished executive whose usually confident demeanor had been replaced with barely contained anxiety. His tailored suit still looked immaculate, but his tie was slightly askew—the Wonderland equivalent of being in complete disarray.

Harvey White scurried to the center stage, carrying a tablet. "Order in the proceedings!" he called out unnecessarily, as the room was already deathly silent. "The Case of Heart versus Hartman will now commence!"

He tapped his tablet, and the screen behind him changed to display an organizational chart with Victor's position highlighted in alarming red. "Victor Hartman, Vice President of Product Strategy and Innovation, stands accused of Class One Intellectual Appropriation—specifically, the theft of conceptual property from Regina Heart's Personal Innovation Journal, volume twelve, section four, paragraphs seven through twenty-three."

Regina approached the podium. "The evidence is irrefutable. My quarterly ideation session on March 3rd produced a revolutionary concept for a 'Stakeholder Sentiment Visualization Dashboard with Integrated Feedback Loops.'" She held up her journal dramatically. "The very next day, Mr. Hartman conveniently presented an identical concept in the Executive Strategy Review, claiming it as his own breakthrough thinking!"

A collective gasp swept through the audience, though Bob noticed several employees exchanging skeptical glances.

"That sounds like a basic user feedback dashboard," Bob whispered.

"Shh!" Morris cautioned. "At Wonderland, the obviousness of an idea is inversely proportional to the credit claimed for conceiving it."

Harvey tapped his tablet again, and the screen displayed side-by-side comparisons of two nearly identical product concept diagrams. "Exhibit A: The CEO's original concept. Exhibit B: The suspiciously similar proposal from Product Development."

To Bob's eye, both appeared to be standard dashboard wireframes with slight cosmetic differences. The only substantial distinction was that Regina's version featured small heart icons as rating buttons, while Victor's used standard star ratings.

Victor stood in the defendant's box, posture rigid. "If I may present my defense—"

"The accused will wait to be called upon!" Regina interrupted sharply. "We will follow proper adjudication protocols!"

Karl approached Regina and whispered something in her ear. She nodded reluctantly.

"We will now hear witness testimony," Regina announced. "Call the first witness."

Harvey consulted his tablet. "The proceedings call Timothy Hatter, Marketing Director."

Timothy bounded onto the stage with his characteristic energy, multiple Bluetooth devices still attached to various parts of his head. His outfit today included a tie that periodically displayed scrolling LED text reading "INNOVATIVE DISRUPTOR."

"Mr. Hatter," Regina began once Timothy was settled in the witness stand, "did you attend the Product Strategy meeting on March 4th?"

"Indeed, indeed!" Timothy confirmed. "A most synergistic convergence of cross-functional thought leaders!"

"And did Victor Hartman present a concept for a Stakeholder Sentiment Visualization Dashboard?"

"He most certainly did articulate a conceptual framework for a multi-modal engagement quantification interface with sentiment analysis capabilities!" Timothy's hands flew wildly as he spoke, nearly dislodging one of his headsets.

"Would you characterize this concept as revolutionary?" Regina pressed.

Timothy hesitated for a microsecond. "It embodied certain transformative elements within the established paradigm of user-centric feedback mechanisms."

Regina's eyes narrowed. "That wasn't my question. Was it revolutionary?"

Timothy's eyes darted nervously between Regina and Victor. "In the context of our current product ecosystem, it represented a meaningful evolution of existing—"

"Just answer the question!" Regina demanded.

"Revolution is a spectrum rather than a binary state!" Timothy blurted out, sweat beading on his forehead. "Disruptive innovation exists on a continuum of incremental to paradigmatic recalibration!"

Regina sighed in frustration. "The witness is clearly attempting to obfuscate. Step down, Mr. Hatter."

Timothy practically ran from the witness stand, adjusting his multiple devices as he returned to his seat.

"Call the next witness," Regina commanded.

"The proceedings call Marcia Hare, Public Relations Manager," Harvey announced.

Marcia approached the stand with visible anxiety, clutching multiple phones to her chest like protective talismans. As she took her seat, one phone buzzed, causing her to jump slightly.

"Ms. Hare," Regina began, "did you prepare a press release regarding the new dashboard on March 4th?"

"Y-yes," Marcia confirmed, her eyes constantly checking her phones. "A draft announcement of the new feature was created as per standard protocol."

"And who was credited with the innovative concept in that draft?"

Marcia swallowed hard. "The initial draft credited the Product team, as the submission came from their department."

"I see," Regina said coldly. "And were you specifically instructed to credit Mr. Hartman?"

"We follow standard attribution protocols based on project submission forms," Marcia explained, visibly uncomfortable. "If there was an attribution error—"

"So you admit there was an error?" Regina pounced.

"I didn't say that!" Marcia protested. "I simply meant that if proper credit should have gone to you, then—"

"So you acknowledge that proper credit belonged to me?" Regina interrupted triumphantly.

Marcia looked desperately toward Karl, who gave her a subtle nod of encouragement. "Our process follows the project documentation," she said carefully. "If the original concept originated elsewhere, our attribution would be updated accordingly."

"Convenient ambiguity," Regina remarked. "You may step down."

As Marcia hurried back to her seat, Regina turned to the audience. "I find it remarkable how reluctant my leadership team seems to be about acknowledging the obvious theft of intellectual property."

She gestured to Harvey, who tapped his tablet. The screen changed to display a dashboard mock-up with Regina's name prominently watermarked across it.

"This is my original concept, documented in my innovation journal and timestamped in the Wonderland Ideation Repository," Regina declared. "Yet somehow, Mr. Hartman presented an almost identical concept as his own work the very next day."

She turned to the executive row. "Shall we hear from Technical Services about the timestamp records?"

A nervous IT manager halfway stood, then immediately sat back down. "The, uh, timestamps are valid according to system records," he stammered.

"There we have it," Regina said with satisfaction. "Technological confirmation."

From his position near the back, Bob leaned toward Morris. "This is ridiculous. Are dashboard concepts really worth this level of drama?"

"It's not about the dashboard," Morris whispered back. "It's about control and credit. Regina believes all good ideas should either come from her or be attributed to her."

"But surely some of these executives will stand up to this?" Bob wondered.

Gregory shook his head. "The last VP who challenged Regina's claim to an idea now manages our paper clip inventory in a windowless office."

The proceedings continued with several more witnesses, each carefully navigating Regina's leading questions while trying not to explicitly contradict her or throw Victor completely under the bus. The testimony grew increasingly convoluted as executives attempted verbal acrobatics to avoid making definitive statements.

Finally, Regina turned to Victor. "The accused may now present his defense."

Victor rose with dignity despite his precarious position. "Thank you, Ms. Heart. I categorically deny stealing any intellectual property. The dashboard concept I presented was the culmination of six months of user research conducted by my team, with development work dating back to November of last year."

He gestured to the screen, where Harvey reluctantly displayed a series of dated design documents and meeting notes.

"As these records show, we've been iterating on this concept since Q3 of last year," Victor continued. "The similarity to your journal entry is coincidental—unsurprising given that sentiment analysis dashboards are an industry standard feature."

A murmur spread through the crowd. Regina's expression darkened.

"Are you suggesting," she said dangerously, "that my groundbreaking innovation was somehow... unoriginal?"

Victor paled slightly but held his ground. "I'm stating that great minds often reach similar conclusions when addressing the same problems. Our research indicated users needed better feedback visualization, and both of us independently recognized that need."

"A convenient explanation," Regina scoffed. She turned to Harvey. "Present the written evidence."

Harvey tapped his tablet once more, and the screen displayed an email thread. "Exhibit C: An email from Mr. Hartman to his team dated March 3rd, the same day as Ms. Heart's journal entry."

Regina read from the highlighted portion: "'I just had a revelation about how we could improve our dashboard. Let's discuss tomorrow.'" She looked up triumphantly. "A 'revelation' on the exact same day I documented my concept!"

"That's completely circumstantial," Victor objected. "The email doesn't specify what the revelation was—it could have been about any aspect of the dashboard we'd been working on for months."

"The timing is suspiciously convenient," Regina insisted. "How do you explain that?"

"Corporate synchronicity," Victor replied. "When multiple people are focused on the same business problems, parallel thinking occurs. It's not theft—it's convergent innovation."

This seemed to resonate with some audience members, who nodded in agreement. Regina noticed and quickly changed tactics.

"The Personal Innovation Journal in question was stored in my private office," she countered. "How would you have known about my concept unless you had somehow accessed it?"

Victor looked genuinely confused. "I had no knowledge of your journal entry. As I've shown, our team has documentation proving the concept's ongoing development for months."

Regina turned to the audience dramatically. "I propose a different theory. Someone on Mr. Hartman's team—or perhaps Mr. Hartman himself—gained unauthorized access to my office, viewed my Innovation Journal, and passed along the revolutionary concept, allowing him to suddenly have a 'revelation.'"

Bob whispered to Morris, "Can she really believe this conspiracy theory?"

"Whether she believes it is irrelevant," Morris replied quietly. "The accusation itself serves her purpose—reinforcing that all innovation should flow through her."

Regina continued building her case, each allegation more elaborate than the last. The dashboard concept had evolved from a simple feature into "groundbreaking intellectual property critical to Wonderland's competitive differentiation."

Finally, she turned to the executives in the front row. "The evidence has been presented. The coincidence is too precise to be accidental. Mr. Hartman clearly appropriated my intellectual property and claimed it as his own. As per Wonderland's Intellectual Property Protection Protocol, section 72.3, such an offense is grounds for immediate termination and potential legal action."

Karl stepped forward, speaking for the first time during the proceedings. "Before a determination is made, perhaps we should hear from Mr. Hartman's team about the dashboard's development timeline."

"An excellent suggestion," said Victor gratefully.

"Unnecessary," Regina countered. "The evidence speaks for itself."

"But due process requires—" Karl began.

"Due process has been observed," Regina interrupted firmly. "We've seen the timestamps, the email, and the suspicious similarity of the concepts."

She addressed the executive row. "I call for a decision. All those who agree that Mr. Hartman misappropriated intellectual property, raise your hands."

There was an excruciatingly tense moment where no hands moved. Regina's gaze swept across the executives, who squirmed uncomfortably under her scrutiny. Slowly, reluctantly, hands began to rise—first from those most dependent on Regina's favor, then gradually others who clearly feared being the odd ones out.

From the back of the room, Bob noticed that none of them would meet Victor's eyes. The VP of Product stood straight-backed but resigned, watching his colleagues choose political survival over truth.

"The decision is near-unanimous," Regina declared, ignoring the few hands that had remained defiantly down. "Victor Hartman is found responsible for intellectual property theft."

Karl again whispered something to Regina, who nodded curtly.

"However," she continued, "in recognition of Mr. Hartman's years of service to Wonderland, the penalty will be reduction in rank rather than termination. Mr. Hartman is hereby demoted to Director of Legacy Product Maintenance, effective immediately."

Victor's face remained impressively stoic, though the punishment was clearly severe—Legacy Product Maintenance was notorious as the department where careers went to die.

"This matter is concluded," Regina announced. "Let this serve as a reminder that at Wonderland, we take intellectual property very seriously. All innovations should flow through proper channels." The unspoken implication—that "proper channels" meant Regina herself—was lost on no one.

As the crowd began to disperse, Bob noticed an unusual commotion near the front of the room. Dora, the perpetually sleepy intern from the Marketing Department, had approached the stage and was speaking animatedly to Karl. Despite her typically drowsy demeanor, she appeared fully alert and insistent.

"What's happening there?" Bob asked, nodding toward this unexpected development.

Morris followed his gaze. "That's odd. The intern speaking up during an Adjudication Event? Unprecedented."

"And potentially career-ending," Gregory added grimly. "Contradicting Regina immediately after a judgment is corporate suicide."

They watched as Karl listened to Dora with increasing interest, then reluctantly approached Regina, who had been gathering her materials to leave. Whatever Karl said caused Regina to freeze, then slowly turn toward the intern with a dangerous expression.

"This doesn't look good," Morris murmured. "Poor kid. She must be new enough not to understand the unwritten rules."

To everyone's surprise, Regina didn't immediately dismiss Dora but instead appeared to be listening, her expression cycling between disbelief and anger. After a brief exchange, Regina suddenly addressed the departing crowd.

"One moment!" she called, her voice cutting through the noise. "It appears we have new information regarding the dashboard concept."

The exodus halted instantly, employees freezing in place as if suddenly paused in a corporate version of musical statues.

Regina's voice was tight with barely controlled fury. "It seems that neither I nor Mr. Hartman originated the dashboard concept. According to Ms. Mouse from Marketing Internship Program, the initial idea was presented in an intern brainstorming session in October of last year."

A shocked murmur rippled through the crowd. Regina held up a hand for silence.

"Ms. Mouse claims to have documentation proving that her team developed a prototype of the sentiment analysis dashboard as part of their Q4 innovation project, which was submitted to both the Product team and Executive Review Committee."

Victor looked as shocked as everyone else. "I never received any such submission," he protested.

"Nor did I," Regina added coldly.

Karl checked something on his tablet, then whispered to Regina again. Her expression darkened further.

"It appears," Regina announced with evident distaste, "that the intern team's proposal was filed under 'Junior Innovation Initiatives' and marked for 'Future Consideration' by the Submissions Review Committee."

The implications hit the room like a thunderclap. Both Regina and Victor had essentially reinvented a concept already developed by interns—a concept that had been bureaucratically buried in Wonderland's labyrinthine approval processes.

"This matter requires further investigation," Regina declared. "The judgment regarding Mr. Hartman is temporarily suspended pending review of this new information."

With that, she swept off the stage, Karl hurrying behind her.

The atrium erupted into frenzied conversation as employees processed this shocking development. Victor remained on stage, looking simultaneously relieved at his temporary reprieve and disturbed by the revelation.

"Did that intern just save Victor's career?" Bob asked incredulously.

"Temporarily," Gregory replied. "Though she may have sacrificed her own in the process."

"Actually," Morris mused, "this might be the one scenario where Regina backs down. Being wrong is bad, but being shown to have the same idea as an intern is far worse in her mind. She'll want this entire incident forgotten as quickly as possible."

They watched as Dora returned to her seat, seemingly unaware of the corporate earthquake she had just triggered. Timothy and Marcia converged on her immediately, their expressions a mixture of horror and admiration.

"We should go," Gregory advised. "When Regina retreats to reconsider, it's best not to be visible during the cooling-off period."

As they moved toward the exit, Harvey's voice came over the speaker system: "All employees, please return to your regular duties. The Mandatory Morale Event will resume in fifteen minutes with the Team Synchronicity Exercise!"

A collective groan went up from the crowd.

"Perfect timing for our escape," Morris said, quickening his pace. "The post-adjudication confusion combined with Mandatory Morale dread creates optimal conditions for a clean exit."

They had almost reached the door when Harvey appeared in front of them, looking even more harried than usual.

"Henderson!" he exclaimed, spotting Bob. "There you are! Regina wants to see you immediately."

Bob felt his stomach drop. "Me? Why?"

"Something about being a neutral observer since you're new," Harvey explained breathlessly. "She's assembling an ad-hoc committee to review the interns' dashboard submission, and she wants someone with 'fresh eyes and no political affiliations' to participate."

Morris and Gregory exchanged alarmed glances.

"That's... quite an honor for a first day," Morris said carefully.

"Or a perfect setup for a scapegoat," Gregory muttered under his breath.

"Conference Room A, five minutes," Harvey instructed before rushing off to deliver more summonses.

"What do I do?" Bob asked, genuinely concerned. "I know nothing about dashboards or intellectual property policies."

"That might actually be your salvation," Morris said thoughtfully. "Regina likely wants someone she can influence who has no preexisting loyalties. Just act impressed by her insights and avoid any definitive statements."

"And if directly questioned, develop a sudden coughing fit," Gregory advised. "Works every time."

"This is insane," Bob said, shaking his head. "I've been here less than a day, and I'm already being pulled into executive power struggles."

"Welcome to Wonderland," Morris said with a sympathetic pat on Bob's shoulder. "Where your job title is made up and your actual work doesn't matter."

As Bob reluctantly headed toward Conference Room A, he wondered how his straightforward first day at a new job had devolved into this corporate theater of the absurd. Between Regina's kangaroo court, Victor's public humiliation, and the shocking intern revelation, he had witnessed more drama in a few hours than in his entire previous career.

"Conference Room A is on the third floor, east wing," Morris called after him. "Just follow the trail of anxious executives!"

Bob nodded his thanks and headed toward the elevator, Morris's notebook of corporate translations tucked securely in his pocket. If he was going to survive this bizarre turn of events, he would need all the Wonderland wisdom he could get.

As the elevator doors closed, he caught a final glimpse of the atrium. The judge's bench was being quickly disassembled, while employees reluctantly gathered for the resumption of mandatory team building. Above it all, the large screen now displayed a single message:

"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ADJUDICATION: TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED.
MANDATORY MORALE EVENT: PARTICIPATION NON-NEGOTIABLE.
REGULAR CORPORATE ACTIVITIES: CONTINUE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE."

It was, Bob reflected, the perfect summary of his Wonderland experience thus far: chaos masquerading as order, drama disguised as process, and nowhere, absolutely nowhere, a hint of actual productive work being done.

The elevator began its ascent toward what promised to be yet another baffling chapter in his increasingly surreal first day.
