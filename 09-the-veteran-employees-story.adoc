== The Veteran Employee's Story

The Institutional Memory Preservation Unit was unlike any other part of Wonderland, Inc. that Bob had seen. While the rest of the building featured modern, sterile spaces with motivational slogans and cutting-edge technology, this room was a corporate time capsule. Wood-paneled walls held framed newspaper clippings and vintage company advertisements. Glass display cases contained obsolete office equipment—typewriters, fax machines, and early mobile phones the size of bricks. The lighting was warm rather than fluorescent, and comfortable leather chairs had replaced the ergonomic monstrosities found elsewhere.

Morris sat in a worn executive chair that had clearly been custom-fitted to his frame through decades of use. He was a round-shouldered man with thinning gray hair and kind eyes that looked perpetually on the verge of tears behind thick glasses. His cardigan—an item Bob hadn't seen anywhere else in the building—bore a faded Wonderland logo from some previous branding era.

Gregory Griffin, by contrast, was all vigor and volume. His pinstriped suit was several shades brighter than would be considered professional in most offices, and his booming voice seemed calibrated to fill boardrooms. He sat forward in his chair, constantly fidgeting as if impatient for his turn to speak.

"Sit, sit!" Gregory insisted, gesturing to an empty chair. "You've arrived at precisely the right moment. Morris was about to explain Wonderland's legendary professional development program!"

Morris smiled wistfully. "The Corporate Advancement Curriculum. Not like today's microlearning modules and gamified training platforms. We had real mentorship back then, real skills development."

"Morris here was one of the original employees," Gregory told Bob. "Started back when the company was just three people in a garage."

"Well, not a garage," Morris corrected gently. "It was a renovated bank building. And there were seventeen of us initially. But yes, I've been with Wonderland longer than anyone still employed here."

"How long exactly?" Bob asked, genuinely curious.

Morris sighed deeply. "Forty-seven years, eight months, and..." he checked his watch, which Bob noticed had both digital and analog displays, "fourteen days."

"That's impressive," Bob said. "You must have seen a lot of changes."

"Changes?" Morris's eyes grew distant. "I've witnessed seven complete company reinventions, twenty-three rebranding initiatives, thirty-eight reorganizations, and fifty-two shifts in our 'core business focus.' The only constant at Wonderland is inconstancy."

"And success!" Gregory added boisterously. "Don't forget our spectacular market dominance!"

"In what market exactly?" Bob asked, hoping to finally get a straight answer about what Wonderland actually did.

Morris and Gregory exchanged glances.

"It's... evolved over time," Morris said carefully. "We began as a humble office supply company. Then pivoted to business services. Then enterprise solutions. Then digital transformation consultancy. Then platform ecosystem enablement."

"And now?" Bob pressed.

Morris shrugged. "The current official designation is 'cross-vertical innovation accelerator with proprietary disruption methodologies,' but that'll change by next quarter, I'm sure."

"Fascinating history," Gregory interrupted impatiently. "But tell him about the education program! The curriculum! The corporate schooling that made Wonderland legendary!"

Morris's expression brightened. "Ah, yes. The Corporate Advancement Curriculum. Nothing like today's half-hour webinars and self-guided e-learning."

He stood and moved to a glass cabinet, retrieving a leather-bound binder labeled "Employee Development Matrix - 1986." Opening it reverently, he showed Bob a complex chart with interconnected boxes and arrows.

"Every new employee went through a comprehensive developmental journey," Morris explained. "We called the fundamental courses the Four Ms: Minuting, Memoing, Mailing, and Meeting."

"Like reading, writing, and arithmetic?" Bob suggested.

"Precisely!" Morris beamed at Bob's understanding. "Minuting was the art of recording meeting discussions while tactfully omitting politically damaging comments. Memoing covered the delicate balance of conveying information while avoiding accountability. Mailing taught proper corporate communication hierarchies—who to include, who to CC, who to BCC, and most importantly, who to strategically exclude."

"And Meeting?" Bob asked.

"That was the crown jewel," Morris said with genuine nostalgia. "A sixteen-week course on conducting effective meetings, including advanced techniques like the False Consensus, the Strategic Derailment, and the Career-Advancing Insight Attribution."

"I mastered that last one particularly well," Gregory interjected proudly. "Once claimed credit for an idea three seconds after someone else suggested it. No one even noticed! Got promoted the following week."

"The curriculum then branched into specialized disciplines," Morris continued, turning pages in the binder. "The Arithmetic of Business: Addition of Resources, Subtraction of Costs, Multiplication of Requirements, and Division of Blame."

"Don't forget Distraction Management!" Gregory added. "I was the department champion three years running. Could completely derail any project review in under sixty seconds."

Morris nodded. "Then came the advanced corporate sciences: Reorganization Theory, Buzzword Etymology, Strategic Ambiguity, and my personal specialty, Historical Revisionism."

"Historical Revisionism?" Bob asked.

"The art of reframing past corporate failures as strategic stepping stones to current successes," Morris explained. "Absolutely essential for quarterly shareholder presentations. I once transformed a catastrophic product launch that cost millions into a 'valuable market insight acquisition initiative' that 'laid the groundwork for our current strategy.'"

"He's being modest," Gregory declared. "Morris could make a complete corporate disaster sound like a stroke of genius! Remember the Metaverse Immersion Platform debacle of 2022?"

Morris winced. "We don't talk about that one."

"Why not? Your revisionist framing saved at least three executive careers!"

"Some failures exceed even my revisionist capabilities," Morris admitted sadly.

He returned to his chair, the leather binder resting in his lap like a cherished photo album. "After completing the standard curriculum, employees could specialize in advanced disciplines. I chose Corporate Anthropology with a concentration in Legacy Protocol Preservation."

"I went into Sales Mythology and Competitive Exaggeration," Gregory said. "Graduated top of my class."

"I believe it," Bob said, unable to keep a hint of amusement from his voice.

Morris turned to another section of the binder, revealing photographs of employees in what appeared to be a classroom setting, all wearing identical Wonderland polo shirts and earnest expressions.

"Each Friday, we'd gather for Narrative Alignment sessions," he continued. "We'd practice describing our job functions in increasingly abstract terms until even we didn't understand what we did anymore."

"I remember those!" Gregory laughed heartily. "Started as 'I sell business services to medium-sized companies' and ended as 'I facilitate paradigm-shifted value propositioning through strategic relationship architecture to drive cross-platform synergistic outcomes in the mid-market heterogeneous enterprise continuum.'"

"That was the goal," Morris nodded, a tear forming in the corner of his eye. "Total linguistic obscuration of actual job function. The true mark of corporate advancement."

"What happened to this program?" Bob asked. "It sounds... comprehensive."

Morris sighed deeply, the sound of a man who had witnessed the decline of something he truly valued, however absurd it might seem to outsiders.

"Budget optimization," he said bitterly. "The Great Efficiency Revolution of 2003. All instruction was digitized and reduced to bullet points. Sixteen-week courses became thirty-minute webinars. Deep skill development was replaced with 'just-in-time learning' and 'microcompetencies.'"

Gregory shook his head solemnly. "A travesty. You can't teach Strategic Ambiguity in a microlearning module. It's an art form that requires nurturing."

"That's why we've lost our way," Morris lamented. "Today's Wonderland employees can't properly obscure a simple business function to save their lives. Ask them what they do, and some will actually tell you in plain language! Can you imagine?"

"The horror," Gregory agreed, though with a wink to Bob that suggested he found Morris's traditionalism somewhat amusing.

"It seems like Wonderland has changed a lot," Bob observed.

"Changed?" Morris clutched the binder tighter. "It's unrecognizable. We once had principles—confusing, contradictory principles, but principles nonetheless."

He stood again, moving to a wall display featuring a faded mission statement in an ornate frame. "Our original ethos: 'To systematically facilitate exceptional synergies while maintaining strategic alignments.'"

"What does that actually mean?" Bob asked.

"Nothing!" Morris declared, as if this were its greatest virtue. "That was the beauty of it! It could mean anything or nothing, depending on what was expedient at the moment. Perfect corporate flexibility."

Gregory nodded appreciatively. "Not like today's mission statements with all their specific commitments to sustainability and social responsibility. How do you pivot away from that when the market changes? No wiggle room at all."

Morris returned to his chair, visibly tired from the emotional journey through corporate history. "The current training program is just a shadow of what we once had. New hires now get a one-hour orientation video and access to a learning portal no one ever visits."

"Which explains why you're wandering around looking lost," Gregory said to Bob. "No proper corporate educational foundation!"

"I do feel particularly unprepared for whatever Wonderland is," Bob admitted.

Morris leaned forward, suddenly earnest. "It's not too late for you. I could teach you the old ways. The proper techniques of corporate advancement."

"I... appreciate the offer," Bob said cautiously.

"First lesson would be Selective Listening," Morris continued with growing enthusiasm. "Essential for surviving meetings where direct questions might result in unwanted accountability."

"Followed by Responsibility Diffusion," Gregory added. "I taught that module for years. Could make a project failure so thoroughly distributed that even the person who caused it would join in blaming an abstract market force."

"Then Strategic Visibility Calibration," Morris said, warming to the topic. "Knowing precisely when to be seen by executives and when to become mysteriously unavailable."

The two older employees began outlining an increasingly absurd curriculum, each trying to outdo the other with ridiculous-yet-familiar corporate skills. Bob listened with growing fascination as they mapped out what amounted to a master class in corporate game-playing and politics.

"—and by week twelve, you'd be ready for Advanced Blame Deflection," Morris was saying, his eyes shining with nostalgic fervor. "I once redirected accountability for a failed product launch to a weather pattern in the South Pacific. Got a commendation for 'environmental awareness' while my colleagues were reassigned."

"Impressive," Gregory acknowledged. "But can you top my Reverse Accountability Maneuver of 2011? Turned a missed deadline into a promotion by convincing leadership that only by advancing to senior management could I ensure such delays never happened again."

"That's nothing compared to—" Morris began, but stopped suddenly, his enthusiasm deflating like a punctured balloon. "But what's the point? The old ways are dying. Soon no one will remember when Wonderland was... well, not normal, exactly, but consistently abnormal in ways we understood."

His melancholy was so genuine that Bob felt a surprising surge of sympathy, despite the absurdity of what Morris was lamenting.

"How did Wonderland end up this way?" Bob asked gently. "It seems like there's no actual business happening here—just meetings, performance reviews, and corporate rituals."

Morris and Gregory exchanged knowing glances.

"You've noticed that, have you?" Morris said, sounding both impressed and saddened. "Most new hires take months to see through the activity to the emptiness beneath."

"Wonderland was once a real company with real products," Gregory explained, his bombastic tone subdued for the first time. "But somewhere along the way..."

"We forgot the business and became a self-sustaining system of corporate processes," Morris finished. "Meetings about meetings. Reports about reporting. Performance reviews of performance review processes."

"But how does the company make money?" Bob asked, the question that had been bothering him all day.

Morris smiled sadly. "An excellent question that no one can definitively answer anymore. There are departments that process payments and investments, but where the money ultimately comes from? It's become something of a corporate mystery."

"My theory is that we're actually an elaborate tax write-off for some larger entity," Gregory offered. "Or possibly a sociological experiment."

"I maintain we're still selling something somewhere," Morris countered. "But the layers of management and matrix reporting have obscured it even from ourselves."

He closed the binder with a sense of finality. "Whatever the truth, Wonderland continues. The quarterly reviews happen. The paychecks clear. The reorganizations come and go. And long-timers like me gradually fade away."

"You're not actually fading away," Gregory pointed out practically. "You're retiring next month with a generous pension."

"That's not the point," Morris said with mild irritation. "I'm making a metaphorical statement about institutional memory and corporate evolution."

"Ah, sorry. Carry on with the poetic lamentation then."

Morris turned to Bob with sudden intensity. "The real question is: what will you do now that you've glimpsed behind the corporate curtain? Most choose to play along, collect their paychecks, and never speak of the fundamental emptiness at Wonderland's core."

"I'm not sure yet," Bob admitted. "I still need to figure out what my actual job is supposed to be—or if I even have one."

"If you have a badge and an email account, you're real enough to Wonderland," Gregory said with a philosophical shrug. "The rest is just details."

"Speaking of details," Morris said, glancing at a complex scheduling chart on the wall. "It's almost time for the Mandatory Morale Event in Celebration Plaza."

"The what?" Bob asked.

"Mandatory Morale Event," Gregory repeated. "Regina insists on company-wide gatherings after quarterly reviews to 'restore team cohesion' after her firing spree."

"Which usually means awkward team building exercises followed by forced socializing over lukewarm appetizers," Morris added.

He stood up with a grunt, his joints protesting after so long in his chair. "I'd invite you to join us, but as a new employee, you'd be expected to participate in the Traditional Newcomer Showcase."

"Which is?" Bob asked warily.

"Each new hire must perform a corporate-themed talent or recite company values in the form of an inspirational poem," Gregory explained. "Established by Regina to 'quickly identify team players and cultural fits.'"

"That sounds horrible," Bob said without thinking.

"It is," both men agreed in unison.

"Is there any way to avoid it?" Bob asked.

Morris and Gregory exchanged looks.

"Well," Gregory said thoughtfully, "there is one group exempt from mandatory events. The Conference Call Coordination Team."

"They're perpetually on calls with international offices," Morris explained. "Regina exempted them after several embarrassing incidents of overseas clients overhearing team-building chants."

"How do I find them?" Bob asked.

"Down the hall, third door on the left. Look for the sign that says 'Global Engagement Synchronicity Hub,'" Morris directed. "Though I should warn you, they're somewhat... particular about their protocols."

"Thank you," Bob said sincerely. "For everything. This has been the most straightforward conversation I've had all day, despite being about the most absurd corporate education program I've ever heard of."

Morris smiled, the melancholy lifting slightly from his features. "Sometimes absurdity becomes so consistent it forms its own kind of clarity."

"Before you go," Gregory said, reaching into his jacket pocket, "take my card. If you survive your first week at Wonderland, I may have a spot for you in Sales Enablement. We could use someone who sees through the nonsense."

Bob accepted the business card, which was printed on unusually thick stock and seemed to change color slightly when tilted—a needlessly premium feature that somehow perfectly represented Gregory's character.

"And this," Morris added, removing a small, worn notebook from his cardigan pocket. "My personal glossary of Wonderland terminology with translations into plain English. Forty-seven years of corporate doublespeak decoding. Might help you navigate the linguistic labyrinth."

"I couldn't take this," Bob protested. "It must be valuable to you."

"I've memorized every entry," Morris assured him. "Besides, my corporate journey is nearly complete. Yours is just beginning. Consider it the last lesson from the old curriculum: Strategic Knowledge Transfer."

Touched by the gesture, Bob carefully pocketed the notebook. "I hope we meet again under less bizarre circumstances."

"At Wonderland? Unlikely," Gregory laughed. "But perhaps slightly less bizarre, if you're lucky."

As Bob turned to leave, Morris called after him. "Remember—when the monthly BPE report comes due, claim you're on the TPX taskforce! No one knows what it is, but everyone's afraid to admit it!"

With this final piece of cryptic advice, Bob left the Institutional Memory Preservation Unit and headed down the hall in search of the Conference Call Coordination Team. He walked with slightly more confidence than before, Morris's notebook a reassuring weight in his pocket.

The hallway was quieter than most areas of Wonderland, with fewer motivational posters and more actual informational signage. Bob found the door marked "Global Engagement Synchronicity Hub" and was about to knock when he heard multiple voices speaking in the strangely formal cadence of people on a conference call.

"Can everyone hear me?"
"If you're speaking, we can't hear you."
"I think you're on mute."
"Who just joined?"

Bob recognized the familiar rhythms of corporate conference calls—a strange dance of technology and human awkwardness that somehow functioned as business communication. He knocked softly and entered, hoping to find a refuge from Wonderland's more extreme absurdities.

What he found instead was an entirely new form of corporate madness.
