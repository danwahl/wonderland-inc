Project setup loosely based on https://github.com/progit/progit2/[Pro Git book].

== How To Generate the Book

You can generate the e-book files manually with Asciidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at wonderland-inc.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at wonderland-inc.epub
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF output at wonderland-inc.pdf
----

You can generate just one of the supported formats (HTML, EPUB, or PDF).
Use one of the following commands:

To generate the HTML book:

----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

To generate the EPUB book:

----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_epub
----

To generate the PDF book:

----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_pdf
----
