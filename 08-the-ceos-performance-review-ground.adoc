== The CEO's Performance Review Ground

The rooftop of Wonderland, Inc. had been transformed into an elaborate corporate garden, complete with manicured hedges trimmed into shapes of ascending bar graphs and topiary sculptures of business icons giving thumbs up. A large banner stretched across the entrance: "QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION EVENT: EXECUTE OR BE EXECUTED."

Bob stepped cautiously onto the lawn, staying close to a large hedge to avoid immediate detection. The roof was far more extensive than seemed physically possible given the building's dimensions from outside. It stretched across the entire building footprint, with different sections designated by signs such as "Revenue Acceleration Zone" and "Productivity Enhancement Arena."

In the center of this corporate Wonderland, a large group of employees in formal business attire were frantically setting up what looked like game stations, though with distinctly corporate elements. People rushed about with clipboards and tablets, occasionally colliding with each other in their haste.

Near one of the stations, Bob noticed three employees on their knees, hunched over what appeared to be large presentation boards. They were frantically changing numbers on charts with correction fluid and markers.

Curious, Bob edged closer to observe them.

"Hurry up, Steve!" one of them whispered urgently. "She'll be here any minute!"

"I'm going as fast as I can, Tina," replied Steve, a young man whose company polo shirt was already stained with marker ink. "These quarterly results are impossible to make look good."

"Just keep adding growth indicators," said the third employee, whose name tag read "Frank." "Change the red downward arrows to green upward ones."

"But the numbers clearly show a twelve percent decline," Frank protested.

"That's why we're calling it a 'strategic revenue reallocation' instead of a 'loss,'" Derek explained, splashing green ink over a particularly alarming red section. "It's all about narrative framing."

"But won't Regina notice we've changed the data?" Steve asked nervously.

Tina and Frank exchanged alarmed glances. "Keep your voice down!" Tina hissed. "And of course she'll notice. She notices everything. But she'd rather see manipulated positive data than honest negative data."

"What happens if she realizes we've altered the presentation?" Steve persisted.

"Last quarter, the analytics team showed actual numbers without 'enhancements,'" Frank said grimly. "Three of them were fired on the spot. The fourth was transferred to the Siberian satellite office."

"We don't have a Siberian office," Steve pointed out.

"We do now. Just him, in a shed, with a laptop that can't connect to the internet."

Steve gulped audibly and redoubled his efforts to improve the data visualizations.

Bob was about to retreat when one of them spotted him. All three froze like deer in headlights.

"Who are you?" Tina demanded, quickly hiding the correction fluid behind her back. "Are you from Internal Audit?"

"No, I'm new," Bob explained, showing his badge. "Just started today. I'm trying to find my way around."

The three employees visibly relaxed.

"Well, you shouldn't be up here," Frank said, though without hostility. "This area is restricted during quarterly reviews."

"I was trying to avoid—" Bob began, but was interrupted by the sound of an electronic fanfare blasting from speakers around the garden.

"Too late," Tina groaned. "She's coming. May the market forces be in your favor, new guy."

Before Bob could retreat, a procession emerged from the other end of the rooftop garden. First came a line of employees in matching gray suits, carrying tablets and digital displays with charts and graphs. They marched in perfect synchronization, their faces expressionless as they formed a pathway for the executives behind them.

Behind the tablet-bearers came various executives in ascending order of apparent importance, each with a larger entourage than the last. Bob recognized Harvey White scurrying alongside a particularly stern-looking woman. From the way others cleared a path and cast nervous glances her way, Bob assumed she must be a senior vice president or higher in the corporate hierarchy.

Finally, Regina Heart herself appeared, radiating an aura of absolute authority. She wore a crimson power suit with subtle heart-shaped buttons, and her expression suggested she was perpetually disappointed with everything and everyone around her. Beside her walked a milder-looking man in a navy suit who seemed to be trying to make himself as unobtrusive as possible while still keeping pace with Regina.

"That's Karl Heart, the COO," Frank whispered to Bob. "Regina's husband. He tries to moderate her... enthusiasm for terminations."

The procession moved toward the center of the garden where a raised platform had been set up, allowing Regina to survey her corporate domain. She stepped onto it and began scanning the assembled employees with the calculating gaze of a predator assessing potential prey.

"The First Quarterly Performance Review of 2025 will now commence!" announced Harvey, his voice quavering slightly despite his attempt at ceremonial gravity.

Regina's sharp eyes suddenly fixed on the area where Bob stood with the three employees and their doctored presentations.

"What is happening there?" she demanded, her voice cutting through the garden. "Why aren't those revenue projections on display yet?"

Tina, Derek, and Frank scrambled to lift their boards, revealing charts with hastily altered numbers showing improbable growth across all metrics.

Regina descended from her platform and strode toward them, the crowd parting before her like the Red Sea. She examined the presentations with narrowed eyes.

"Who is responsible for the Southeast region data?" she asked in a dangerously calm voice.

Steve raised a trembling hand. "I am, Ms. Heart."

"And you believe that region showed twenty-six percent growth after last quarter's fifteen percent decline?"

"Well, the, um, strategic initiatives and, uh, synergistic market approaches have—" Steve stammered.

"You're fired," Regina stated flatly. "Clear your desk by noon."

"But—" Steve began.

"Did I stutter?" Regina's voice remained eerily calm. "You. Are. Fired."

As Steve slunk away, Karl stepped forward and whispered something in Regina's ear. She waved him off irritably but then called out, "Human Resources will contact you about outplacement services. We're not monsters."

Karl gave a small, relieved nod before retreating back to a safe distance.

Regina's gaze then fell on Bob. "And who is this? I don't recognize this employee."

"Bob Henderson, ma'am," he replied, trying to project confidence. "I started today."

"First day and already at the executive quarterly review? Either impressively ambitious or woefully misdirected." She examined his badge. "Transformation Catalyst? That's not a real position."

"I believe HR created it last month during the reorganization," Karl offered gently. "Part of the Paradigm Integration Team?"

Regina frowned but seemed to accept this explanation. "Very well. Since you're here, you might as well participate. Everyone present must demonstrate their value to Wonderland."

Before Bob could protest, Harvey approached with a tablet. "The performance review activities are ready to commence, Ms. Heart."

"Excellent." Regina turned to address the assembled crowd. "Today, each of you will demonstrate your ability to hit your targets under changing market conditions. Success means continued employment. Failure..." She let the implication hang in the air.

Employees were directed to various stations throughout the garden. Bob found himself assigned to a section labeled "Agile Adaptation Assessment," along with about a dozen other nervous-looking staff members.

Each participant was given what appeared to be a corporate mini-golf putter, although they barely resembled normal golf clubs. These "Strategic Implementation Tools" had been over-engineered with unnecessary features—ergonomic grips designed by the UX team that were actually uncomfortable to hold, slightly off-balance weighting for "optimal kinetic energy transfer," and handles covered in corporate terminology and usage instructions. What should have been simple golf putters had been improved into near-uselessness.

"Welcome to the Corporate Performance Golf Assessment," a coordinator explained, gesturing to what Bob now realized was an elaborate miniature golf course spread across the lawn. Each hole featured different corporate-themed obstacles and was labeled with business objectives like "Market Penetration" and "Synergy Optimization."

"The objective is simple," the coordinator continued. "Navigate your Opportunity Sphere through the course and into the Achievement Holes. Your score directly impacts your quarterly evaluation."

"What's the correct hole sequence?" asked a participant beside Bob.

"That depends on your assigned department's quarterly focus," the coordinator replied. "Check your badge for your current strategic imperative."

Bob looked at his badge, which now displayed "Innovation Pipeline Expansion" in small letters that definitely hadn't been there before.

"The course will open momentarily," the coordinator announced. "Remember, this is a performance assessment with direct implications for your quarterly evaluation."

Harvey blew a whistle, and suddenly the lawn was chaotic activity. Employees struggled with their unwieldy putters, attempting to guide their Opportunity Spheres toward the appropriate holes. The task was nearly impossible—the over-engineered putters made simple shots difficult, the putting surfaces were subtly uneven, and most confusingly, staff members under Regina's direction kept rearranging the course obstacles.

"Pivot to digital transformation!" Regina shouted. "Course reconfiguration for cloud-based initiatives!"

This caused a mad scramble as employees tried to redirect their efforts toward newly prioritized holes. Bob watched in amazement as perfectly normal business professionals desperately struggled with the absurd challenge, their faces showing genuine fear of failure.

Bob's own attempt was disastrous. The grip on his putter rotated slightly when he applied pressure, causing his swing to veer off-center and sending his Opportunity Sphere rolling into a water hazard labeled "Sunk Cost Repository."

Regina prowled the course, occasionally stopping to observe someone's performance with a critical eye. "You call that market penetration? You're fired!" she declared to one unfortunate manager whose ball had gone into a sand trap. "Your customer retention strategy lacks commitment! Fired!" she announced to another whose putt stopped short of the hole.

After each declaration, Karl would hurry over to the devastated employee and whisper something that seemed to moderate their despair. Bob overheard him telling one, "Just go to HR tomorrow. She always reconsiders half of these by morning."

As Bob struggled to retrieve a new ball from the coordinator, he noticed Harvey approaching with obvious anxiety.

"You're wanted at the executive challenge area," Harvey informed him, glancing nervously over his shoulder at Regina. "The CEO has taken a specific interest in your performance as a new hire."

"But I don't even know what I'm doing here," Bob protested.

"None of us truly does," Harvey replied with a hint of unexpected insight that made Bob look at him with new interest. Then, returning to his usual flustered state: "Just come quickly before she notices a delay!"

Bob followed Harvey to a more elaborate section of the lawn where Regina stood waiting with several executives. This area had larger gateways and was decorated with premium-looking corporate swag—branded water bottles, deluxe notebooks, and ergonomic stress relievers.

"Henderson," Regina acknowledged him curtly. "As a self-proclaimed 'Transformation Catalyst,' show us how you would transform our approach to cross-departmental alignment."

She handed him a putter that was even more absurdly over-engineered than the previous one—featuring multiple grip sections labeled for different "power scenarios," weighted with "precision balance technology," and branded with motivational corporate slogans along the shaft that actually distracted from the task.

"Complete the Paradigm Shift hole," she commanded, pointing to a particularly elaborate setup where the hole itself rotated on a motorized platform while mechanical obstacles continuously moved across the putting green.

Bob awkwardly gripped the overcomplicated putter, fully expecting to fail spectacularly. By sheer luck, when he attempted a gentle tap, the ball made contact with the small section of the putter head that wasn't covered in "impact enhancement technology," sending it on an unlikely trajectory that navigated all the obstacles and rolled perfectly into the hole just as it rotated into position.

A stunned silence fell over the group.

"Did... did he just achieve paradigm transformation on his first attempt?" one executive whispered to another.

Regina's eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Beginner's luck," she declared. "Or perhaps..." Her voice turned accusatory, "...insider knowledge of our proprietary performance metrics?"

"I assure you, I have no idea what's happening," Bob said truthfully.

"A likely story!" Regina's voice rose. "No one achieves paradigm shifting without at least four planning sessions and a dedicated task force!"

Karl diplomatically intervened. "Perhaps Mr. Henderson simply has a natural talent for transformative thinking? Isn't that why HR created the position?"

Regina seemed unconvinced but was distracted by a commotion elsewhere on the lawn. "What now?" she demanded, striding away to investigate.

Bob exhaled in relief at her departure. Harvey gave him a look that seemed equal parts impressed and concerned.

"You've attracted her attention," Harvey warned. "That's rarely advantageous for one's career longevity."

"I'm beginning to realize that," Bob replied, watching Regina fire two more employees for failing to properly "leverage cross-platform synergies" with their pointers.

As the chaotic performance review continued around him, Bob noticed a familiar face watching from beneath a decorative tree. Cheri Fisher leaned casually against the trunk, observing the scene with that same knowing smile he'd seen earlier. She beckoned him over with a subtle gesture.

Bob glanced around to ensure no one was watching, then quickly made his way to the tree.

"Enjoying the quarterly performance theater?" Cheri asked, her smile widening as their eyes met.

"This is insane," Bob replied quietly. "People's careers depend on their ability to hit stress balls with floppy sticks?"

Cheri considered this for a moment, her eyes tracking Regina across the lawn. "You're seeing only the surface," she said. "Regina doesn't actually care about the game. She's watching how people react to impossible demands and shifting targets."

Bob watched as an executive desperately tried to please Regina by contorting himself into an uncomfortable position to hit a target, only to have her change the rules mid-attempt.

"That's... actually more disturbing," Bob admitted.

"Is it?" Cheri tilted her head curiously. "In a way, it's the most honest thing that happens at Wonderland. Everywhere else, the absurdity is disguised as rational business practice. Here, at least, the arbitrary nature of corporate success is made explicit."

Bob considered this perspective. "I suppose there's a certain transparency to it. But why does everyone put up with this? Why don't they just quit?"

Cheri's expression shifted to something more knowing. "Golden handcuffs, Stockholm syndrome, and the sunk cost fallacy—the holy trinity of corporate retention. Most have been here so long they've forgotten there are other ways to work."

Their conversation was interrupted by Regina's voice booming across the garden: "The market conditions have shifted! All previous metrics are obsolete! New targets will now be distributed!"

This announcement caused visible distress among the employees, many of whom had just begun to make progress with the previous set of goals.

"The review seems to be entering its chaotic crescendo phase," Cheri observed. Her expression grew serious as she glanced toward the security personnel by the exits. "If I were you, I'd consider making a discreet exit before Regina's final evaluation round. The termination rate typically peaks in the third hour."

"How do I get out of here?" Bob asked, eyeing the stairwell door, which was now guarded by two security personnel.

Cheri glanced around, then leaned closer. "There's a service elevator behind the 'Exceeding Expectations' topiary," she said quietly. "Not many people know about it."

"Thank you," Bob said sincerely.

"Don't mention it," Cheri replied with a slight nod. "I've worked here long enough to know all the back doors and workarounds. Some of us need to maintain our independence to survive in this environment."

With that, she slipped away, moving through the crowd with remarkable ease, nodding to people who seemed surprised to see her, as if she rarely appeared at these events.

As Bob pondered what Cheri had told him, a commotion erupted across the lawn. Regina had discovered Tina and Derek's manipulated data presentations.

"These growth projections have been falsified!" she bellowed, her face turning almost as red as her suit. "The Southeast region is clearly underperforming, yet these charts show record growth!"

"We were just trying to present the data in the most favorable light," Tina attempted to explain.

"Fired!" Regina declared. "Both of you! And where is Steve? He's fired again!"

Karl whispered something to her.

"Fine," Regina amended. "Demoted to the data integrity verification team, which I am creating this instant specifically to verify the integrity of all future presentations!"

Taking advantage of the distraction, Bob slipped away toward the topiary Cheri had mentioned. He found the service elevator tucked discreetly behind an enormous shrub shaped like a businessman giving two thumbs up. The doors opened at the press of a button.

Bob stepped inside, grateful to escape the bizarre performance review. As the doors closed, he caught one last glimpse of the corporate garden: Regina pointing accusingly at a terrified executive, Karl quietly damage-controlling behind her, and employees desperately trying to hit their moving targets with impossibly floppy pointers.

The elevator began to descend. Bob leaned against the wall, exhausted by the day's increasingly strange experiences. According to his watch, he had been at Wonderland, Inc. for approximately seven hours, yet had witnessed more corporate absurdity than in his entire previous career.

"I need to find a way out of this place," he muttered to himself.

The elevator came to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a quiet, dimly lit corridor. A sign on the wall indicated he was in the "Legacy Systems Archive."

As Bob stepped out, he heard a familiar voice from down the hall—a melancholy tone that stood out from the manic energy he'd encountered throughout most of the building.

"...and that's when we realized that stakeholder engagement wasn't just a metric, but a philosophy," the voice was saying. "Of course, that was before the Great Reorganization of '19. Things were different then. More... authentic."

His curiosity piqued, Bob followed the voice to a door labeled "Institutional Memory Preservation Unit." Inside, he found an older employee in a vintage company polo shirt speaking to an attentive man in a loud, pinstriped suit who Bob didn't recognize.

"Ah, a visitor!" the man in the suit announced upon seeing Bob. "Perfect timing! Morris was just explaining how Wonderland's corporate culture evolved. Essential knowledge for anyone trying to navigate this place, wouldn't you say?"

The older employee—presumably Morris—turned to Bob with a wistful smile. "Always happy to share the history with someone who might actually appreciate it. Come in, young man. Let me tell you about the old days at Wonderland, when corporate education meant something."

Bob hesitated at the threshold, uncertain about getting drawn into yet another strange encounter. But after the chaos of the performance review, this quiet room seemed almost welcoming. And perhaps understanding Wonderland's past might help him navigate its bizarre present.

He stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.
