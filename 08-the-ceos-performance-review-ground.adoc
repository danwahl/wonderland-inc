== The CEO's Performance Review Ground

The rooftop of Wonderland, Inc. had been transformed into an elaborate corporate garden, complete with manicured hedges trimmed into shapes of ascending bar graphs and topiary sculptures of business icons giving thumbs up. A large banner stretched across the entrance: "QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION EVENT: EXECUTE OR BE EXECUTED."

Bob stepped cautiously onto the lawn, staying close to a large hedge to avoid immediate detection. The roof was far more extensive than seemed physically possible given the building's dimensions from outside. It stretched for what appeared to be acres, with different sections designated by signs such as "Revenue Acceleration Zone" and "Productivity Enhancement Arena."

In the center of this corporate Wonderland, a large group of employees in formal business attire were frantically setting up what looked like game stations, though with distinctly corporate elements. People rushed about with clipboards and tablets, occasionally colliding with each other in their haste.

Near one of the stations, Bob noticed three employees on their knees, hunched over what appeared to be large presentation boards. They were frantically changing numbers on charts with correction fluid and markers.

Curious, Bob edged closer to observe them.

"Hurry up, Seven!" one of them whispered urgently. "She'll be here any minute!"

"I'm going as fast as I can, Two," replied Seven, a young man whose company polo shirt was already stained with marker ink. "These quarterly results are impossible to make look good."

"Just keep adding growth indicators," said the third employee, who Bob presumed was Five based on the conversation. "Change the red downward arrows to green upward ones."

"But the numbers clearly show a twelve percent decline," Seven protested.

"That's why we're calling it a 'strategic revenue reallocation' instead of a 'loss,'" Five explained, splashing green ink over a particularly alarming red section. "It's all about narrative framing."

"But won't Regina notice we've changed the data?" Seven asked nervously.

Two and Five exchanged alarmed glances. "Keep your voice down!" Two hissed. "And of course she'll notice. She notices everything. But she'd rather see manipulated positive data than honest negative data."

"What happens if she realizes we've altered the presentation?" Seven persisted.

"Last quarter, the analytics team showed actual numbers without 'enhancements,'" Five said grimly. "Three of them were fired on the spot. The fourth was transferred to the Siberian satellite office."

"We don't have a Siberian office," Seven pointed out.

"We do now. Just him, in a shed, with a laptop that can't connect to the internet."

Seven gulped audibly and redoubled his efforts to improve the data visualizations.

Bob was about to retreat when one of them spotted him. All three froze like deer in headlights.

"Who are you?" Two demanded, quickly hiding the correction fluid behind his back. "Are you from Internal Audit?"

"No, I'm new," Bob explained, showing his badge. "Just started today. I'm trying to find my way around."

The three employees visibly relaxed.

"Well, you shouldn't be up here," Five said, though without hostility. "This area is restricted during quarterly reviews."

"I was trying to avoid—" Bob began, but was interrupted by the sound of an electronic fanfare blasting from speakers around the garden.

"Too late," Two groaned. "She's coming. May the market forces be in your favor, new guy."

Before Bob could retreat, a procession emerged from the stairwell he had used. First came a line of employees in matching gray suits, carrying tablets instead of the playing card spears from Alice's adventure. They marched in perfect synchronization, their faces expressionless.

Behind them came various executives in ascending order of apparent importance, each with a larger entourage than the last. Bob recognized Harvey White scurrying alongside a particularly stern-looking woman who he assumed was a senior vice president based on how others cleared a path for her.

Finally, Regina Heart herself appeared, radiating an aura of absolute authority. She wore a crimson power suit with subtle heart-shaped buttons, and her expression suggested she was perpetually disappointed with everything and everyone around her. Beside her walked a milder-looking man in a navy suit who seemed to be trying to make himself as unobtrusive as possible while still keeping pace with Regina.

"That's Karl Heart, the COO," Five whispered to Bob. "Regina's husband. He tries to moderate her... enthusiasm for terminations."

The procession moved toward the center of the garden where a raised platform had been set up, allowing Regina to survey her corporate domain. She stepped onto it and began scanning the assembled employees with the calculating gaze of a predator assessing potential prey.

"The First Quarterly Performance Review of 2025 will now commence!" announced Harvey, his voice quavering slightly despite his attempt at ceremonial gravity.

Regina's sharp eyes suddenly fixed on the area where Bob stood with the three employees and their doctored presentations.

"What is happening there?" she demanded, her voice cutting through the garden. "Why aren't those revenue projections on display yet?"

Two, Five, and Seven scrambled to lift their boards, revealing charts with hastily altered numbers showing improbable growth across all metrics.

Regina descended from her platform and strode toward them, the crowd parting before her like the Red Sea. She examined the presentations with narrowed eyes.

"Who is responsible for the Southeast region data?" she asked in a dangerously calm voice.

Seven raised a trembling hand. "I am, Ms. Heart."

"And you believe that region showed twenty-six percent growth after last quarter's fifteen percent decline?"

"Well, the, um, strategic initiatives and, uh, synergistic market approaches have—" Seven stammered.

"You're fired," Regina stated flatly. "Clear your desk by noon."

"But—" Seven began.

"Did I stutter?" Regina's voice remained eerily calm. "You. Are. Fired."

As Seven slunk away, Karl stepped forward and whispered something in Regina's ear. She waved him off irritably but then called out, "Human Resources will contact you about outplacement services. We're not monsters."

Karl gave a small, relieved nod before retreating back to a safe distance.

Regina's gaze then fell on Bob. "And who is this? I don't recognize this employee."

"Bob Henderson, ma'am," he replied, trying to project confidence. "I started today."

"First day and already at the executive quarterly review? Either impressively ambitious or woefully misdirected." She examined his badge. "Transformation Catalyst? That's not a real position."

"I believe HR created it last month during the reorganization," Karl offered gently. "Part of the Paradigm Integration Team?"

Regina frowned but seemed to accept this explanation. "Very well. Since you're here, you might as well participate. Everyone present must demonstrate their value to Wonderland."

Before Bob could protest, Harvey approached with a tablet. "The performance review activities are ready to commence, Ms. Heart."

"Excellent." Regina turned to address the assembled crowd. "Today, each of you will demonstrate your ability to hit your targets under changing market conditions. Success means continued employment. Failure..." She let the implication hang in the air.

Employees were directed to various stations throughout the garden. Bob found himself assigned to a section labeled "Agile Adaptation Assessment," along with about a dozen other nervous-looking staff members.

Each participant was given what appeared to be a standard office pointer—the kind used during presentations—but these had been painted in flamingo pink and had flexible, bendy necks that made them difficult to hold straight.

"Your targets are there," a coordinator explained, pointing to what looked like small round hedges with faces drawn on them. Bob squinted and realized they were stress balls decorated to resemble hedgehogs.

"The objective is simple," the coordinator continued. "Use your Flexible Strategic Pointer to guide your Opportunity Sphere through the appropriate Target Gateway." He indicated a series of small arches set up across the lawn, each labeled with different business metrics like "Increased Market Share" and "Cost Reduction."

"What's the correct gateway?" asked a participant beside Bob.

"That depends on your assigned department's quarterly focus," the coordinator replied. "Check your badge for your current strategic imperative."

Bob looked at his badge, which now displayed "Innovation Pipeline Expansion" in small letters that definitely hadn't been there before.

"The targets will be distributed momentarily," the coordinator announced. "Remember, this is not just a game—it's a metaphorical representation of your ability to adapt to Wonderland's evolving business needs."

Harvey blew a whistle, and suddenly the lawn was chaotic activity. Employees struggled to control their floppy pointers while trying to hit the stress ball "hedgehogs" toward their respective gateways. The task was nearly impossible—the pointers bent unpredictably, the balls moved erratically, and most confusingly, the gateways themselves were being constantly moved by staff members under Regina's direction.

"The renewable energy sector is pivoting!" Regina shouted. "Gateway reassignment for green technology initiatives!"

This caused a mad scramble as employees tried to redirect their efforts toward newly prioritized targets. Bob watched in amazement as perfectly normal business professionals desperately struggled with the absurd challenges, their faces showing genuine fear of failure.

Bob's own attempt was disastrous. His pointer bent completely backward when he tried to use it, and his "Opportunity Sphere" rolled away into a decorative pond labeled "Sunk Cost Repository."

Regina prowled the lawn, occasionally stopping to observe someone's performance with a critical eye. "You call that market penetration? You're fired!" she declared to one unfortunate manager whose ball had gone off course. "Your customer retention strategy lacks commitment! Fired!" she announced to another.

After each declaration, Karl would hurry over to the devastated employee and whisper something that seemed to moderate their despair. Bob overheard him telling one, "Just go to HR tomorrow. She always reconsiders half of these by morning."

As Bob struggled to retrieve a new ball from a coordinator, he noticed Harvey approaching with obvious anxiety.

"You're wanted at the executive challenge area," Harvey informed him, glancing nervously over his shoulder at Regina. "The CEO has taken a specific interest in your performance as a new hire."

"But I don't even know what I'm doing here," Bob protested.

"None of us truly does," Harvey replied with surprising philosophical depth. Then, returning to his usual flustered state: "Just come quickly before she notices a delay!"

Bob followed Harvey to a more elaborate section of the lawn where Regina stood waiting with several executives. This area had larger gateways and was decorated with premium-looking corporate swag—branded water bottles, deluxe notebooks, and ergonomic stress relievers.

"Henderson," Regina acknowledged him curtly. "As a self-proclaimed 'Transformation Catalyst,' show us how you would transform our approach to cross-departmental alignment."

She handed him a pointer that was even more unwieldy than the previous one—this one had multiple bendable sections and seemed to move of its own accord.

"Hit the target through the 'Paradigm Shift' gateway," she commanded, pointing to an arch that was being continuously rotated by two staff members.

Bob awkwardly positioned the uncooperative pointer, fully expecting to fail spectacularly. By sheer luck, when he finally managed to tap the ball, it ricocheted off a nearby executive's shoe and rolled perfectly through the gateway just as it was being turned.

A stunned silence fell over the group.

"Did... did he just achieve paradigm transformation on his first attempt?" one executive whispered to another.

Regina's eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Beginner's luck," she declared. "Or perhaps..." Her voice turned accusatory, "...insider knowledge of our proprietary performance metrics?"

"I assure you, I have no idea what's happening," Bob said truthfully.

"A likely story!" Regina's voice rose. "No one achieves paradigm shifting without at least four planning sessions and a dedicated task force!"

Karl diplomatically intervened. "Perhaps Mr. Henderson simply has a natural talent for transformative thinking? Isn't that why HR created the position?"

Regina seemed unconvinced but was distracted by a commotion elsewhere on the lawn. "What now?" she demanded, striding away to investigate.

Bob exhaled in relief at her departure. Harvey gave him a look that seemed equal parts impressed and concerned.

"You've attracted her attention," Harvey warned. "That's rarely advantageous for one's career longevity."

"I'm beginning to realize that," Bob replied, watching Regina fire two more employees for failing to properly "leverage cross-platform synergies" with their pointers.

As the chaotic performance review continued around him, Bob noticed a familiar face watching from beneath a decorative tree. Cheri Fisher leaned casually against the trunk, her ever-present smile widening as their eyes met. She beckoned him over with a subtle gesture.

Bob glanced around to ensure no one was watching, then quickly made his way to the tree.

"Enjoying the quarterly performance theater?" Cheri asked, her smile somehow growing even wider.

"This is insane," Bob replied quietly. "People's careers depend on their ability to hit stress balls with floppy sticks?"

"The medium is not the message here," Cheri observed. "Regina doesn't actually care about the game. She's watching how people react to impossible demands and shifting targets."

"That's... actually more disturbing," Bob admitted.

"Is it?" Cheri's head tilted curiously. "In a way, it's the most honest thing that happens at Wonderland. Everywhere else, the absurdity is disguised as rational business practice. Here, at least, the arbitrary nature of corporate success is made explicit."

Bob considered this perspective. "I suppose there's a certain transparency to it. But why does everyone put up with this? Why don't they just quit?"

Cheri's smile took on a knowing quality. "Golden handcuffs, Stockholm syndrome, and the sunk cost fallacy—the holy trinity of corporate retention. Most have been here so long they've forgotten there are other ways to work."

Their conversation was interrupted by Regina's voice booming across the garden: "The market conditions have shifted! All previous metrics are obsolete! New targets will now be distributed!"

This announcement caused visible distress among the employees, many of whom had just begun to make progress with the previous set of goals.

"The review seems to be entering its chaotic crescendo phase," Cheri observed. "If I were corporeal throughout the entirety of the physical plane, which is debatable, I would suggest making a discreet exit before Regina's final evaluation round. The termination rate typically peaks in the third hour."

"How do I get out of here?" Bob asked, eyeing the stairwell door, which was now guarded by two security personnel.

"The service elevator behind the 'Exceeding Expectations' topiary has been temporarily deactivated for security reasons," Cheri replied with her enigmatic smile. "Which means its badge reader is offline, defaulting to open access."

"Thank you," Bob said sincerely.

"Don't mention it," Cheri replied. "Really, don't. I maintain my position here by appearing simultaneously everywhere and nowhere, providing guidance that cannot be traced to a single source."

With that cryptic statement, Cheri's form seemed to fade slightly, her outline becoming indistinct against the tree.

"Before you go," she added, her voice now seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere, "a word of advice: in Wonderland, the best way to understand the rules is to observe who is allowed to break them."

As Bob pondered this statement, a commotion erupted across the lawn. Regina had discovered Two and Five's manipulated data presentations.

"These growth projections have been falsified!" she bellowed, her face turning almost as red as her suit. "The Southeast region is clearly underperforming, yet these charts show record growth!"

"We were just trying to present the data in the most favorable light," Two attempted to explain.

"Fired!" Regina declared. "Both of you! And where is Seven? He's fired again!"

Karl whispered something to her.

"Fine," Regina amended. "Demoted to the data integrity verification team, which I am creating this instant specifically to verify the integrity of all future presentations!"

Taking advantage of the distraction, Bob slipped away toward the topiary Cheri had mentioned. He found the service elevator tucked discreetly behind an enormous shrub shaped like a businessman giving two thumbs up. As predicted, the badge reader showed an "Out of Service" light, but the doors opened at the press of a button.

Bob stepped inside, grateful to escape the bizarre performance review. As the doors closed, he caught one last glimpse of the corporate garden: Regina pointing accusingly at a terrified executive, Karl quietly damage-controlling behind her, and employees desperately trying to hit their moving targets with impossibly floppy pointers.

The elevator began to descend. Bob leaned against the wall, exhausted by the day's increasingly strange experiences. He had been at Wonderland, Inc. for less than eight hours, yet had witnessed more corporate absurdity than in his entire previous career.

"I need to find a way out of this place," he muttered to himself.

The elevator came to a stop, and the doors opened to reveal a quiet, dimly lit corridor. A sign on the wall indicated he was in the "Legacy Systems Archive" on a floor that wasn't shown on any of the building maps he'd seen.

As Bob stepped out, he heard a familiar voice from down the hall—a melancholy tone that stood out from the manic energy he'd encountered throughout most of the building.

"...and that's when we realized that stakeholder engagement wasn't just a metric, but a philosophy," the voice was saying. "Of course, that was before the Great Reorganization of '19. Things were different then. More... authentic."

His curiosity piqued, Bob followed the voice to a door labeled "Institutional Memory Preservation Unit." Inside, he found an older employee in a vintage company polo shirt speaking to an attentive Gregory Griffin, whose loud suit and booming voice Bob recognized from the descriptions in the employee handbook he'd briefly glimpsed during orientation.

"Ah, a visitor!" Gregory announced upon seeing Bob. "Perfect timing! Morris was just explaining how Wonderland's corporate culture evolved. Essential knowledge for any new hire, wouldn't you say?"

The older employee—presumably Morris—turned to Bob with a wistful smile. "Always happy to share the history with someone who might actually appreciate it. Come in, young man. Let me tell you about the old days at Wonderland, when we had a corporate education program worth experiencing."

Bob hesitated, but his desire for answers overcame his reluctance. Perhaps understanding Wonderland's past would help him navigate its bizarre present. He stepped into the room and closed the door behind him, unwittingly entering yet another strange chapter in his Wonderland, Inc. journey.
