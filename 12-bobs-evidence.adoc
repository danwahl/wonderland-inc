== Bob's Evidence

Conference Room A bore the unmistakable tension of an emergency executive meeting. The large oval table was surrounded by anxious faces, with Regina Heart at the head, her crimson suit somehow even more intimidating in the confined space. Karl sat to her right, looking weary, while Victor Hartman occupied a chair noticeably further from Regina than his VP status would normally warrant.

Most surprising was the presence of Dora, the intern, who sat uncomfortably at the far end, clutching a tablet and looking as though she deeply regretted her moment of courage. Several other executives filled the remaining seats, their expressions carefully neutral—the corporate equivalent of prey animals trying to avoid drawing a predator's attention.

Bob slipped into the room as quietly as possible, but Regina immediately fixed him with her penetrating gaze.

"Henderson. Finally. Take a seat." She pointed to an empty chair directly across from her. It was, Bob realized with dismay, the worst possible position—fully exposed to Regina's scrutiny with nowhere to hide.

"As I was saying," Regina continued once Bob was seated, "this situation requires immediate resolution. We have three conflicting claims to the same intellectual property: my original concept, Mr. Hartman's alleged independent development, and now this... intern submission."

She said "intern submission" with the same tone someone might use for "toxic waste spill."

"Since Mr. Henderson is new to Wonderland and has no existing allegiances," Regina continued, "he will serve as our neutral evaluator. Henderson, your task is simple: review the evidence and determine the true originator of the Stakeholder Sentiment Visualization Dashboard concept."

Bob felt all eyes turn to him. "I appreciate your confidence," he began cautiously, "but I'm not sure I'm qualified to—"

"Your application indicated experience with project analysis and process evaluation," Regina interrupted. "Those skills are precisely what's needed here—an objective assessment of the timeline and documentation."

Bob had no recollection of emphasizing such skills in his job application, but contradicting Regina seemed unwise. "I'll do my best," he conceded.

"Excellent. Let's begin with the intern submission," Regina said, nodding to Dora. "Ms. Mouse, present your evidence."

Dora tapped nervously on her tablet, and the large screen on the wall displayed a presentation dated October 17 of the previous year. "This was our Innovation Challenge project," she explained, her voice surprisingly steady despite her evident anxiety. "Our brief was to identify pain points in customer feedback collection and propose solutions."

She advanced through several slides showing research, user interviews, and finally a prototype dashboard design that was unmistakably similar to both Regina's and Victor's concepts.

"We submitted this to the Junior Innovation Portal on November 3rd," Dora continued. "According to protocol, it should have been reviewed by both Product Development and the Executive Committee within thirty days."

One of the executives leaned forward. "Where did your team initially get this concept?"

Dora hesitated, glancing nervously at Regina. "We... we used Wonderchat during our brainstorming session. We gave it a prompt asking for dashboard ideas to visualize customer feedback, and it generated the basic framework. We then refined it based on actual user needs."

A cold silence fell over the room. Regina's expression froze somewhere between disbelief and horror.

"You're saying," Regina said slowly, each word precisely measured, "that this supposedly revolutionary concept came from our in-house chatbot?"

"We used it as a starting point," Dora clarified. "But yes, the sentiment analysis visualization with real-time feedback loops was in its response to our prompt."

Victor looked distinctly uncomfortable. "I never received this submission," he repeated from earlier. "The Junior Innovation Portal reports to HR, not Product."

Karl checked something on his tablet. "According to the system logs, the submission was received and routed to Initial Screening, where it was categorized as 'Promising But Premature' and placed in the Quarterly Review queue."

"Which means it entered administrative limbo," one of the other executives muttered.

Regina shot him a sharp look before turning back to Dora. "Why didn't you follow up when you received no response?"

"We did," Dora replied, gaining confidence. "Three times. We received automated responses saying our submission was 'In Process' and would be 'Escalated to Appropriate Stakeholders in Alignment with Strategic Priorities.'"

Several executives winced at this familiar corporate non-answer.

Next, Victor presented his evidence—a comprehensive documentation trail showing progressive development of dashboard concepts dating back months. His team had indeed been working on similar functionality long before Regina's journal entry, though their version had evolved through multiple iterations.

Finally, Regina presented her documentation—primarily her innovation journal entry with its timestamp and several follow-up notes expanding on the concept.

"The core innovation here," she insisted, "is the integration of sentiment analysis with real-time response channeling. That specific combination was my breakthrough."

Bob studied all three presentations carefully. To his eye, they represented variations on the same basic concept, with Regina's version distinguished mainly by its heart-shaped interface elements and Victor's by its technical feasibility. Dora's intern team had, in fact, proposed the fundamental approach first, though with less polished execution.

"Mr. Henderson," Regina prompted, "your assessment?"

Bob took a deep breath. This was clearly a political minefield, and Morris's advice to remain noncommittal seemed wisest. Yet something about the absurdity of the situation—the territorial squabbling over a dashboard design, the bureaucratic burial of good ideas, the performative corporate theater—made it suddenly difficult to play along.

He had spent less than a day at Wonderland, Inc., yet had witnessed more dysfunction, waste, and absurdity than in his entire previous career. The sheer disconnection from productive reality had passed from amusing to frustrating to genuinely concerning.

"Based on the documentation," Bob began carefully, "it appears that the intern team was first to formally propose the core concept. Mr. Hartman's team independently developed similar functionality through their ongoing product work. And Ms. Heart's journal entry, while containing some unique interface elements, represents a convergent solution to the same problem."

The room went silent. Bob had just done the unthinkable—he had failed to declare Regina the rightful originator.

Regina's eyes narrowed. "Perhaps you misunderstood the evidence," she said, her voice dangerously quiet. "My concept clearly represents a paradigm shift in approach."

"With respect," Bob replied, feeling a strange confidence growing within him, "a sentiment analysis dashboard is a standard business tool. The implementations vary in details but share the same fundamental purpose and structure."

"Are you suggesting my innovation is... common?" Regina's voice had dropped to an icy whisper.

The other executives were staring at Bob with expressions ranging from horror to reluctant admiration. Victor sat perfectly still, as if movement might attract predatory attention. Dora looked simultaneously terrified and vindicated.

"I'm suggesting," Bob continued, unable to stop himself, "that multiple people at Wonderland independently reached similar conclusions because it's an obvious solution to a common problem. The real issue isn't who thought of it first, but why good ideas get trapped in bureaucratic processes regardless of their source."

Karl sucked in a sharp breath. Regina's face flushed to match her suit.

"You clearly don't understand how innovation works at Wonderland," she said, rising slightly from her chair. "Perhaps your position isn't a good fit after all."

"Respectfully, Ms. Heart," Bob replied, standing as well, "I don't think anyone understands how innovation works at Wonderland—or if it works at all. From what I've seen today, this company is so preoccupied with meetings about work, reviews of work, and disputes over credit for work that no actual work ever gets done."

The statement hung in the air like a corporate blasphemy. Several executives audibly gasped. Victor unsuccessfully tried to disguise a smile as a cough. Dora's eyes widened to their fullest extent, possibly for the first time since her employment began.

Regina stood fully now, her presence seeming to expand until it dominated the room. "Mr. Henderson, you are hereby—"

"Let me guess," Bob interrupted, feeling a strange sense of liberation. "Fired? Demoted? Reassigned to paper clip inventory in North Dakota?"

"Bob," Karl warned quietly.

But Bob had reached his breaking point—the tipping point where the fear of corporate consequences was outweighed by the absurdity of it all.

"This entire company is nothing but a collection of buzzwords disguised as a business," he continued. "In the hours I've been here, I've yet to see a single person doing anything that creates actual value. It's all corporate theater—ritualistic performances where the script is written in meaningless jargon and the only goal is avoiding blame while claiming credit!"

As Bob spoke, something strange began to happen. The conference room seemed to shift around him—the walls becoming less solid, the executives' faces blurring slightly at the edges. Regina's voice sounded increasingly distant as she demanded his badge and declared his employment terminated.

"You can't fire me," Bob realized suddenly, "because I don't actually work here. My position doesn't exist. This entire company might not exist in any meaningful sense. You're all just corporate roles pretending to be people, following scripts instead of thinking, moving papers from one desk to another and calling it productivity!"

The room was definitely changing now—the solid corporate environment giving way to something less substantial. The executives' business attire seemed to shimmer, revealing glimpses of organizational charts and business cards underneath. Regina's crimson suit appeared to be composed of hundreds of overlapping policy memos, all stamped with her signature in red.

"You're nothing but a stack of business cards!" Bob declared.

With those words, the conference room dissolved entirely. The executives, Regina, the furniture—all of it began swirling around Bob like papers caught in a wind, business cards and PowerPoint slides and meaningless charts all flying through the air in a corporate cyclone.

Bob felt himself falling, or perhaps rising—the sensation was ambiguous as the entire Wonderland, Inc. headquarters collapsed into corporate confetti around him.

Then, suddenly, silence.

Bob opened his eyes to find himself sitting in a perfectly normal reception area. Sunlight streamed through large windows, illuminating a clean, professional space with the Cornerstone Enterprises logo displayed on the wall. A young receptionist looked at him with mild concern.

"Mr. Henderson? Are you alright?" she asked. "You seemed to drift off for a moment there."

Bob blinked, disoriented. "I... yes. Sorry about that."

"No problem at all," she smiled. "Your onboarding manager will be with you in just a few minutes. First day nerves are completely normal."

Bob looked around, confirming that he was indeed in the reception area of Cornerstone Enterprises—the company he had actually accepted a job with. Not Wonderland, Inc. There was no Regina Heart, no Corporate Adjudication Event, no Conference Call Quadrille.

"Did I fall asleep?" he asked, embarrassed.

"Just a little catnap," the receptionist assured him. "You've only been waiting about fifteen minutes. Reception can be a bit too comfortable sometimes."

Bob checked his watch—9:15 AM. His entire Wonderland adventure had been nothing more than an elaborate dream during a brief doze in the reception area, waiting for his real first day to begin.

Yet it had felt so vivid, so detailed in its corporate absurdity. He could still picture Regina's imperious expression, Morris's melancholy nostalgic musings, and Timothy's multiple Bluetooth devices.

A door opened, and a friendly-looking woman approached. "Bob Henderson? I'm Jennifer Li, your onboarding manager. Sorry to keep you waiting—our morning status meeting ran long."

Bob stood to shake her hand, suddenly hyperaware of corporate language. "No problem. Status meetings are important," he replied, searching her expression for any hint of Wonderland-like absurdity.

But Jennifer just smiled normally. "Let's get you set up. We'll start with a quick tour, then handle the paperwork, and introduce you to your team before lunch."

As they walked through Cornerstone's offices, Bob was relieved to find everything refreshingly normal. People were engaged in actual work rather than endless meetings about work. The organizational structure seemed logical, the corporate mission clear, the workplace culture professional but pleasant.

"And this will be your desk," Jennifer said, showing him to a perfectly reasonable workspace in an open office area. "Your team lead, Mark, is excited to have you join the project coordination group."

"That is my actual position, right?" Bob asked before he could stop himself. "Project Coordinator?"

Jennifer looked slightly puzzled. "Of course. Just as we discussed in your interviews and specified in your offer letter. Is there a concern?"

"No, sorry," Bob said quickly. "Just confirming."

Later, as Bob sat through a straightforward orientation presentation, he found himself examining everything for signs of Wonderland-like dysfunction. But there were no endless meetings about meetings, no corporate theater, no absurd hierarchies or nonsensical processes. Cornerstone was simply a normal company conducting normal business.

During a break, Bob struck up a conversation with another new hire.

"How's your first day going?" he asked.

"Good so far," she replied. "Though I've already been invited to three different meetings tomorrow. Hopefully they don't take up the whole day."

Bob felt a momentary chill. "What kind of meetings?"

"Oh, standard stuff. Project kickoff, team introduction, systems overview. Nothing too exciting."

Bob nodded, relieved. Normal meetings with actual purposes. Not a Conference Call Quadrille or Mandatory Morale Event in sight.

As the day progressed, however, Bob couldn't shake the lingering effects of his dream. He found himself noticing things he might otherwise have overlooked—the occasional use of buzzwords in company materials, a few inefficient processes, meetings that could have been emails.

During lunch, he overheard fragments of workplace conversations that suddenly seemed loaded with potential Wonderland tendencies:

"Let's circle back on that after the stakeholder review..." +
"We should align our messaging across platforms..." +
"The executive dashboard needs more visual impact..."

None of these were unusual in a corporate environment, but now Bob heard them differently—as warning signs, early indicators of potential corporate absurdity that could, if left unchecked, eventually evolve into full Wonderland dysfunction.

By late afternoon, as Bob completed his first-day paperwork, his manager stopped by.

"How's everything going, Bob? Getting settled in okay?"

"Yes, thank you," Bob replied. Then, unable to resist: "Quick question—what would you say is Cornerstone's approach to innovation? Specifically, how do ideas move from conception to implementation?"

His manager looked thoughtful rather than offended. "That's actually a great question for your first day. We try to maintain clear pathways for ideas, regardless of where they originate. There's a formal submission process, but we also encourage direct conversations. Why do you ask?"

"Just curious about the culture," Bob said. "In some companies, good ideas get lost in bureaucracy or claimed by executives."

His manager laughed. "We're not perfect, but we try to avoid that kind of dysfunction. Ideas should be evaluated on merit, not source."

Bob felt a weight lift from his shoulders. "That's refreshing to hear."

As the workday ended and Bob prepared to leave, he passed the reception area where his strange dream had occurred. The receptionist gave him a friendly wave.

"Successful first day?" she asked.

"Very," Bob confirmed. "Though I had the strangest dream while waiting this morning—an entire alternate corporate reality where everything was absurdly dysfunctional."

She laughed. "Anxiety dreams about work are the worst. Last week I dreamed I had to take minutes for a meeting conducted entirely in interpretive dance."

Bob smiled, but as he left the building, he couldn't help reflecting on his Wonderland experience. Though just a dream, it had felt meaningful—a concentrated, absurdist version of real corporate dysfunctions he'd encountered throughout his career.

Perhaps, he thought, the true value of his Wonderland adventure was as a warning—a symbolically rich catalog of corporate pathologies to recognize and avoid. The meaningless jargon, the bureaucratic mazes, the political gamesmanship, the emphasis on appearance over substance—all were real dangers in any organization, just exaggerated to surreal proportions in his dream.

As Bob walked to his car, he made a silent promise to himself: to remain vigilant against Wonderland-like absurdities in his real corporate life, to prioritize meaning over ritual, productivity over politics, and clarity over jargon.

And if he ever encountered a CEO who demanded that all good ideas be attributed to her, or a marketing director wearing multiple Bluetooth devices, or an IT director perched atop an impossibly tall chair dispensing cryptic advice through vape clouds?

Well, then he'd know he had truly fallen down the corporate rabbit hole.

For now, though, Bob was simply grateful to be starting a normal job at a normal company—where meetings had purposes, dashboards tracked actual data, and no one was ever put on trial for stealing ideas that weren't particularly innovative to begin with.

As he drove home, Bob smiled at the absurdity of his dream and the relief of his reality. Tomorrow would be his first full day at Cornerstone, filled with actual work rather than elaborate corporate theater. He was looking forward to it.

Still, just to be safe, he decided he'd avoid dozing off in reception areas from now on. One trip to Wonderland, Inc. was quite enough for any career.
