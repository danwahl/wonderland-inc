== Down the Corporate Rabbit Hole

Bob Henderson was beginning to get very tired of sitting in the reception area, and of having nothing to do except flip through the same corporate brochures he'd already memorized during his interviews: once or twice he had peeped into his phone, but it had no new emails or notifications in it. "And what is the use of a welcome packet," thought Bob, "without at least some Wi-Fi login information?"

So he was considering, in his own mind (as well as he could, for the hot coffee and early-morning nervousness made him feel simultaneously alert and sluggish), whether the pleasure of making a good first impression was worth the awkwardness of asking the receptionist again about his onboarding manager, when suddenly a thin man with stark white hair rushed past the reception desk.

There was nothing particularly remarkable in that; but Bob did think it a little odd to hear the man mutter to himself, "Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm terribly late for a very important meeting!" Moreover, when the man pulled an iPhone, an Apple Watch, a tablet, and a small paper planner from various pockets, checking each in rapid succession, Bob's curiosity sparked to life.

"Excuse me," Bob called after him, but the man continued his harried pace.

As Bob watched, the white-haired man dropped something - a company ID badge on a lanyard. Without thinking, Bob stood to retrieve it, intending to return it to its owner. The badge displayed a professional headshot of the nervous man alongside the name "Harvey White, Executive Assistant to the Executive Team."

"Sir! You dropped your—" Bob called, but Harvey had already disappeared around a corner. The receptionist seemed oblivious, focusing intently on her computer screen.

Clutching the badge, Bob hesitated only a moment before following. After all, the man might need this to get back into secure areas, and Bob had nothing better to do while waiting. He turned the same corner Harvey had, finding himself in a sleek hallway with frosted glass walls bearing the stylized "W" logo of Wonderland, Inc.

"Mr. White?" Bob called, his voice echoing slightly in the empty corridor.

At the end of the hallway, a door was just closing. Bob jogged toward it, pushing through just in time to see Harvey's white hair bobbing away down another corridor. This hallway was different - darker, with recessed lighting and walls painted a deep blue.

As Bob pursued Harvey through a labyrinth of increasingly unfamiliar passages, he couldn't help but wonder if he was straying too far from reception. "I should probably just give this to security," he thought, but something compelled him forward. Each section of the building had a distinctly different design scheme - modern glass gave way to industrial concrete, then to something resembling a tech startup's idea of a creative space, complete with hanging chairs and nonsensical motivational phrases stenciled on the walls.

*Progress Is Circular!* one proclaimed.

*Failure Is Just Success In Beta!* insisted another.

Bob turned another corner and spotted Harvey slipping into what appeared to be a service elevator at the end of a maintenance corridor. The doors were beginning to close.

"Hold the elevator!" Bob called, breaking into a run.

To his surprise, he made it just in time, slipping through the narrowing gap. Harvey, however, was nowhere to be seen inside the elevator. It was empty.

"That's strange," Bob murmured, turning to exit - but the doors had already sealed shut with a definitive hiss.

The elevator had no buttons. Where a control panel should have been was a sleek black screen that suddenly illuminated with the Wonderland, Inc. logo, pulsing gently.

"Welcome, Harvey White," came a pleasant automated voice. "Biometric scan accepted. Proceeding to requested destination."

Bob looked down at the badge in his hand with dawning realization. The elevator must have scanned it automatically, mistaking him for Harvey.

"Wait, I'm not—"

The elevator lurched downward, cutting off his protest. At first, the sensation was normal, but after a few seconds, Bob realized they were descending much faster than any elevator should. The digital floor indicator began displaying strange designations:

*FLOOR L*

*FLOOR O*

*FLOOR G*

*FLOOR I*

*FLOOR C*

Bob steadied himself against the wall, his stomach dropping with the rapid descent. As his eyes adjusted, he realized the elevator had glass panels on three sides, allowing views into the building as they descended. But what he saw made little sense.

They passed a floor that seemed to contain nothing but an enormous coffee mug, at least ten feet tall, with steam actually rising from its contents. Another floor revealed rows of cubicles sized for giants, with chairs that could seat three people comfortably. Yet another showed what appeared to be a forest of potted plants with computer monitors hanging from their branches like strange technological fruit.

"This can't be real," Bob whispered, pressing his face against the glass.

They passed a floor where employees sat in meetings wearing elaborate animal-head masks. Another where everyone walked in perfect circles around their desks. One floor appeared to be entirely underwater, with workers in business attire seemingly breathing and working normally beneath the surface.

The elevator accelerated further, and the floors began to blur together. Bob felt himself growing lighter, as if the rapid descent was reducing gravity's hold on him. Papers from his messenger bag began to float upward. His tie drifted up to eye level.

"Is this some kind of practical joke for new employees?" he wondered aloud, trying to make sense of the impossible sights. "Some virtual reality thing, maybe?"

The floors continued to flash by, each more bizarre than the last. One contained only a massive clock with hands spinning backwards. Another held nothing but filing cabinets stretching as far as the eye could see. Bob spotted a floor where employees appeared to be aging in fast-forward, their hair growing and graying as they worked.

Just as he was beginning to wonder if the elevator would ever stop, the automated voice returned:

"Approaching destination. Prepare for deceleration."

The elevator slowed gradually, then came to a gentle stop with a cheerful ding. The doors slid open.

"Organizational Substructure Level 42. Mind the gap. Have a productive day."

Bob stepped out cautiously into a dimly lit corridor that looked nothing like the modern tech company he'd arrived at that morning. The walls were paneled in dark wood, with ornate sconces providing weak, flickering illumination. The carpet was a deep red with an intricate pattern that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles.

The elevator doors closed behind him with an ominous thud. When Bob turned back, there was only a smooth wooden wall where the elevator had been.

"Hello?" he called, his voice sounding oddly muffled, as if the corridor was absorbing sound.

No response.

The hallway extended in both directions, curving slightly so that he couldn't see far in either direction. Along the walls were doors - dozens of them - of all different sizes and shapes. Some were tall enough for a basketball player, others so tiny they might accommodate a mouse. Each bore a small brass plaque with strange department names:

*Rapid Growth Team*

*Downsizing Department*

*Lateral Movement Division*

*Strategic Ambiguity Unit*

*Involuntary Advancement Processing*

Bob approached one of the average-sized doors labeled "Orientation & Disorientation Department." He tried the handle, but it was locked.

He tried another door, then another. All locked.

"I need to get back," he muttered, feeling the first flickers of genuine concern. He reached for his phone, but discovered he had no service. Not even emergency calls were available.

At the end of the hall, he noticed a table he hadn't seen before. On it sat a small laptop, open and powered on, displaying a login screen. Next to it was a company keycard attached to a lanyard, and a small USB drive.

Bob approached cautiously. The keycard had his name and photo on it, though he had no memory of having this picture taken. The login screen prompted:

*WELCOME TO WONDERLAND, INC.*
*WHERE NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED*

*USERNAME: BHenderson*
*PASSWORD: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓*

Bob stared at the screen, then at the dark hallway with its numerous doors, then back at what appeared to be his company ID.

"What kind of company is this?" he whispered to the empty corridor.

Somewhere in the distance, a door clicked open.
