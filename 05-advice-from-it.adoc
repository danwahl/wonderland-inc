== Advice from IT

The IT Director's office was unlike anything Bob had seen in the building so far. The space was unusually designed with server towers creating a maze-like interior. The blue glow of multiple monitors provided the primary illumination, giving the room an otherworldly atmosphere.

Bob found Marcus Denton perched on an extremely tall ergonomic chair that had been extended to its maximum height. The IT Director was lanky and pale, dressed in a black turtleneck and designer jeans that contrasted sharply with the corporate dress code Bob had observed throughout Wonderland, Inc. Marcus was vaping continuously, creating clouds that swirled gently around his elevated workspace.

Instead of welcoming Bob or offering assistance, Marcus looked down at him with an expression of detached curiosity. "Who are you?" he asked simply.

"Hello," Bob ventured after an uncomfortable silence. "I was directed here by a sign in the hallway. I'm new, and I'm trying to find my way back to orientation or HR."

Marcus continued to stare at Bob, taking another pull from his vape pen. Finally, he spoke in a languid voice that somehow conveyed both boredom and intensity.

"Who are you?" he repeated, emphasizing each word as if Bob had failed to understand a simple question.

"I just told you—"

"No," Marcus interrupted, "you provided a label and a corporate designation. That's not identity. That's taxonomy." He leaned forward slightly. "Let me be more specific: Who are you on our network?"

Bob paused, unsure how to respond. "I don't think I've been fully onboarded to your systems yet."

Marcus tapped briefly on one of the many keyboards arranged around his elevated workspace. Screens flickered to life, displaying scrolling data.

"Curious," he murmured. "According to our systems, 'Bob Henderson' has been accessing our network for the past three weeks. Seventeen unique logins across twelve different subsystems, including multiple queries about the Dashboard project's data architecture." He looked down at Bob with renewed interest. "Are you certain today is your first day?"

"Absolutely positive," Bob replied, increasingly unsettled. "My offer letter specified February 25th as my start date. Today."

"Yet our digital onboarding template for your profile was initialized on February 3rd. Your virtual identity has been active for some time." Marcus continued scrolling through data screens. "You've already established quite a digital footprint within our systems."

"That's impossible," Bob protested. "I haven't accessed any Wonderland systems before today."

"The logs disagree," Marcus replied calmly. "Perhaps a better question is: What is the relationship between you, the physical entity standing before me, and the digital identity that has been operating under your credentials?"

Bob felt a chill despite the warmth of the server-filled room. "Are you suggesting someone has been using my identity within the company before I even started?"

Marcus took another long pull from his vape pen, the tip glowing blue. "I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely highlighting a discrepancy between physical presence and digital footprint." He exhaled, the vapor forming shapes that almost resembled question marks before dissipating. "Identity is fluid in the modern enterprise. Digital, physical, professional—these are merely facets of a fractured whole."

Bob struggled to make sense of this philosophical tangent. "Look, I think there's been some kind of mix-up. I applied for a Project Coordinator position, received an offer letter, and showed up today as instructed. Anything happening before that wasn't me."

"Intriguing," Marcus replied, sounding genuinely interested for the first time. "A case of digital identity preceding physical instantiation." He tapped more commands into his keyboard. "Your situation is anomalous. But then, anomalies often reveal systemic truths."

More screens illuminated around Marcus's elevated workstation, displaying what appeared to be Bob's entire employment application, along with his social media profiles, credit score, and what looked disturbingly like his private browsing history.

"What are you doing?" Bob asked, alarmed at the invasion of privacy. "How do you have access to all of that?"

"Standard digital footprint analysis," Marcus replied as if it were obvious. "We maintain comprehensive profiles on all employees—past, present, and potential. Your digital shadow extends far beyond what you perceive."

He rotated one of the screens to show Bob a complex diagram that appeared to map his entire online presence, including services Bob didn't even remember signing up for.

"This is—this is invasive," Bob stammered, taken aback by the comprehensive surveillance.

"Privacy is an antiquated concept," Marcus said with a dismissive wave. "Data flows freely within the modern corporate ecosystem. The real question is not what we know about you, but what you know about yourself."

He descended slightly in his chair—though still remaining well above Bob's eye level—and fixed him with a penetrating stare. "So I return to my original query: Who are you?"

There was something in his tone that made the question feel profound rather than repetitive. Bob found himself genuinely considering how to answer, beyond the obvious responses of name and title.

"I'm someone who values clarity and purpose," Bob said after a moment. "I'm detail-oriented but also see the big picture. I'm adaptable but not to the point of losing my core principles. I believe in honest communication and—" He stopped, feeling ridiculous having this existential conversation with an IT Director perched on an absurdly tall chair. "I'm just trying to make sense of this company and find my actual position."

Marcus nodded slowly. "An adequate response. Most new hires simply repeat their LinkedIn profile summary."

He tapped a few more keys, and one by one, the screens displaying Bob's personal information went dark.

"Your confusion is understandable," Marcus continued in his languid tone. "Wonderland operates on principles that often appear counterintuitive to outsiders. The organizational structure is non-Euclidean. Reporting lines form Möbius strips. Departments exist in quantum superposition."

"That doesn't make any sense," Bob said, his patience wearing thin. "A company can't function that way."

"Yet here we are," Marcus replied with the faintest hint of a smile. "Functioning, after a fashion." He took another pull from his vape pen. "The question becomes not whether it makes sense, but how one navigates such a system."

Bob sighed. "That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. How do I navigate back to somewhere familiar? How do I find my actual position? How do I make sense of all this?"

"The answers to those questions depend entirely on what level of access you wish to maintain," Marcus said cryptically. He reached into a drawer and produced two identical USB drives, one white and one black. "Corporate navigation is a matter of permissions and restrictions."

"What are those?" Bob asked, eyeing the drives suspiciously.

"Options," Marcus replied. "The white drive contains administrative credentials—elevated access that will allow you to move freely through most of our systems and physical spaces. The black drive contains restricted credentials—limited access that provides security through obscurity."

He held one drive in each hand, extending them toward Bob. "One will expand your presence within Wonderland. One will contract it. Choose according to your nature."

Bob looked between the two drives skeptically. "And I'm supposed to just choose one without knowing the consequences?"

"All choices have unknown consequences," Marcus replied. "That's what makes them interesting."

"Can't you just give me directions to HR or reception?"

"I could," Marcus conceded, "but that would merely address your immediate circumstance, not your fundamental situation." He continued holding out the drives. "Choose."

Bob weighed his options. The white drive might give him access to find answers, but could also lead to more trouble like what happened with Bill's computer. The black drive sounded limiting, but might keep him out of further chaos until he could make sense of things.

After a moment's hesitation, he reached for the black drive.

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Interesting. Most choose expanded access without consideration of the responsibilities it entails." He withdrew the white drive and handed Bob the black one. "A choice that reflects caution rather than ambition. Noted."

Bob pocketed the USB drive. "Now will you please tell me how to get back to reception or HR?"

"That information is no longer relevant to your trajectory," Marcus said, returning to his full height on the elevated chair. "Your selection has determined your path forward."

"What does that mean?" Bob asked, frustration evident in his voice.

"It means," Marcus explained while typing commands into his system, "that you have chosen a path of observation rather than intervention. The restricted credentials will guide you accordingly."

A door on the far side of the office, which Bob hadn't noticed before, slid open with a soft hiss.

"That exit will lead you to your next destination," Marcus said, already turning his attention back to his screens. "One piece of advice before you depart: in Wonderland, the distinction between advancing and retreating is often illusory. Sometimes to go up, one must first go down. Sometimes to grow larger, one must first become smaller."

"That's not advice," Bob protested. "That's a riddle."

"Is there a difference?" Marcus asked without looking up.

Bob could see that further conversation would be futile. He moved toward the open door, USB drive clutched in his hand.

"One last question," Marcus called as Bob reached the threshold. "What is your primary function here at Wonderland?"

Bob turned back with a frown. "According to my offer letter, project coordination."

"No," Marcus shook his head. "According to your digital footprint analysis and algorithmic role alignment, your primary function appears to be pattern recognition and systemic anomaly identification."

"I don't know what that means," Bob admitted.

Marcus gazed down at him thoughtfully. "It means you see inconsistencies that others have learned to ignore. An unusual quality at Wonderland—both valuable and dangerous." He made a dismissive gesture. "You may proceed."

With no better options, Bob stepped through the doorway, which closed silently behind him. He found himself in yet another corridor, but this one was different—brighter, more modern, with clear directional signs on the walls.

Bob examined the black USB drive in his hand, wondering what restricted access would actually mean for his journey through Wonderland, Inc. He located a nearby computer terminal mounted on the wall and, after a moment's hesitation, inserted the drive.

The screen immediately displayed a map of his current location with a highlighted path. According to the map, he was now on the opposite side of the building from where he had started, in an area labeled "Product Development & Implementation."

Bob removed the drive and pocketed it, somewhat relieved to finally have some clarity about his location. Following the indicated path, he moved through the corridor with growing confidence. The signs and directions were straightforward, the architecture normal. Perhaps he had finally reached a more sensible part of the company.

As he turned a corner, Bob came upon a door labeled "Product Management Suite." From inside, he could hear raised voices—someone was clearly being berated in harsh tones. Bob hesitated, not wanting to walk into another uncomfortable situation, but the mapped path led directly through this department.

Taking a deep breath, he pushed open the door and stepped inside.
